We run a bereavement drop-in centre on the first Wednesday of every month, from 10.30 a.m. until noon. If you are overburdened with a recent loss, or if you are just feeling sad, we want to help. We are here to listen and share your memories of your friend or loved one. We also offer telephone consultations if you do not feel up to coming out.

We normally offer coffee and tea in the hall at St Gregoryâ€™s Church, but the lockdown has recently made that impossible. We hope to start again soon. In the meantime, however, we are still having telephone consultations. Please [email or phone us](../../pages-output/contact/) and leave your details. One of our trained volunteers will contact you.
