We run a bereavement drop-in centre on the first Wednesday of every month, from 10.30 a.m. until noon. If you are overburdened with a recent loss, or if you are just feeling sad, we want to help. We are here to listen and share your memories of your friend or loved one. We also offer telephone consultations if you do not feel up to coming out. Please [email or phone us](../../pages-output/contact/) and leave your details. One of our trained volunteers will contact you.
