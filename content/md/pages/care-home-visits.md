Many of our volunteers have been making weekly visits to the [Brackenbridge House](https://www.goldcarehomes.com/our-homes/brackenbridge-house/) care home. Many of the residents have infrequent callers and our visits have been much appreciated. Our [Minnie Vinnies and B-Attitude](../../pages-output/mentoring/) groups also join us frequently, which the residents find delightful.
