*Opening hours: Saturday, 12:00-14:00*

*Location: The Parish hall, adjacent to the church.*

Our food bank is primarily a distribution centre for [Hillingdon Foodbank](https://hillingdon.foodbank.org.uk/), which is itself part of a larger, [nationwide network](https://www.trusselltrust.org/) of food banks. We distribute a week's worth of essentials to individuals and families in an emergency situation, such as catastrophic illness or unemployment.

In addition, we partner with [FareShare](https://fareshare.org.uk/) to distribute fresh food from major food retailers that would otherwise go to waste. We can also provide smaller parcels of food and essentials (such as toiletries or long-life milk) to those struggling to make ends meet.

When not in the midst of a global pandemic, we would normally offer a cup of tea or coffee and some companionship for the people who visit us. Unfortunately, the coronavirus has meant we've had to temporarily [halt serving any food or drink](../../posts-output/2020-03-21-foodbank-changes/). We hope to start that again soon.
