On Monday evening we held our second monthly meeting online - and the turnout was 13 members - amazing! On  top of that, the previous Friday, 1st May, it was the turn of our Young People's SVP Team and they had an online attendance of eight, which allowed for a very productive monthly meeting too!

We are really blessed to have such great parishioners in the community and please say a prayer that the fruits of their labours will really flourish once this present pandemic passes. Our main actions at present are the [Foodbank](../../pages-output/foodbank/) and the associated home deliveries, including prescriptions pick-ups. The new team of 'temporary' SVP members helping us with all of this are fabulous and are another example of the silver linings to this passing cloud.

As well as this, though, we are phone-buddying with our housebound sisters and brothers and letting them know that they are loved. Please let us know if anyone is being missed and we will be sure to take action. Finally, as always, please be 'Aware' of need in the community and, if help is needed, [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
