Our SVP Conference (the official word for 'team') at St Gregory's was formally founded on 26th April 2016. That means that we are in our fifth year already! The rules of the global SVP society say that every five years we need to have a change of leadership. For us, this means that by 25th April 2021 we need to have a new president in place. A change in leadership is a great opportunity for:

1. New ideas to come forward.
1. A new vision to be set.
1. Developing new ways of doing things.

The SVP Team asks you to please pray that a candidate, or candidates, will come forward during the next 12 months and that we will have a successful election. If you, or someone you know, is interested in knowing more, please get in touch with one of the team. Thanks a million in advance.

Finally, as always, please be 'Aware' of need in the community and, if help is needed, [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
