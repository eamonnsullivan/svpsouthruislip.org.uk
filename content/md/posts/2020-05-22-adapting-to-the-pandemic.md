During this COVID-19 pandemic, everyone has had to adapt to new ways of doing things and the SVP Team is no different. We have had to trim our sails in terms of the variety of active initiatives and our main workstreams at present are focused on the [Foodbank](../../pages-output/foodbank/), including home deliveries, and phone-buddying with our sisters and brothers who are suffering from loneliness and our brothers in [detention](../../pages-output/refugee/). Our home and carehome visits are suspended at the moment and the team really misses meeting our friends at these places.

The SVP, since its foundation, has always been about providing spiritual, as well as physical, help to those in need. Now that our journeys are limited, perhaps this is a good time to think about how we can provide this spiritual help.

The history of how COVID-19 has affected South Ruislip has not yet been written but, when it is, there are bound to be some heartbreaking situations. Would you please say a prayer for all those who may be suffering in silence right now? And please let the [SVP Team know](../../pages-output/contact/) if there is anything we can do.

God Bless!
