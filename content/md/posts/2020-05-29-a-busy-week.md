The new week is a busy one for the SVP as we have our June meeting on Monday evening and then our Young People's SVP have their June meeting on Friday afternoon. Our agendas are naturally curtailed by the COVID19 pandemic, nevertheless, we are still trying to ensure that the needy among us are getting all the help they need. Please say a prayer for the teams and also for our incredible team of 'temporary' members who carry out collections of food from local stores and who perform shopping and home deliveries each Saturday.

This new workstream commenced with Lockdown in March and the fabulous parishioners who came forward to help really are silver linings in the current cloud. On this Pentecost Sunday, it is wonderful confirmation that the Holy Spirit is living with us.

A final request, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
