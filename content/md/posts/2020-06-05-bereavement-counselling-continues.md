Did you know that Bereavement Counselling is one of the services that your SVP Team provide? We are blessed to have four members in the team who have been trained in providing Bereavement Counselling and in 'normal' times they would be available in the hall on the first Wednesday of every month, after the 10am mass, for a couple of hours.

Clearly, due to COVID-19, these monthly drop-in sessions are not currently happening. The Bereavement counsellors are still available on our mobile phone, however, and this replacement 'phone buddying' is working very well. As the phone buddying service is not as visible as the drop-in sessions, though, can you please just be reminded that if you, or someone you know, are suffering from grief then the counsellors are still here to stand by your side and support you. Can you please help us spread this message?

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) with us if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
