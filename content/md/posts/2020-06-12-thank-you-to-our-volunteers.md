Did you know that the UK recently celebrated National Volunteers Week? It was from June 1st to 7th. This year it was especially significant, due to the pandemic, and so it is an opportune moment to say 'Thank You' to all who support the SVP in the parish, and globally too.

In the parish, we have the Mini-Vinnies (primary school ages), the Young Persons SVP (secondary school and university ages) and the 'Full Member' SVP Team (the grown-ups). Importantly, though, we also have a team of what you might call 'Temporary SVP Members', who have come together as a result of the pandemic to help with home deliveries of prescriptions and food, who collect fresh food donations from local shops and who phone-buddy the housebound.

All of this work, of course, is just a simple manifestation of the Holy Spirit working within the community, and we are very blessed that this is the case. Please say a prayer that this continues to be so.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) with us if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
