A stranger was strolling past the Foodbank last Saturday when the queue and the banter of the clients attracted his attention. He turned around and came to get a closer look. A minute later and he was comfortably sitting on a chair, guitar removed from his back, and warming up his vocal chords. He treated us to a joyful half-hour of songs, finishing with How Great Thou Art!

The Foodbank session was very busy, the 'new normal', and we never got to say thank you to this brother of ours. Hopefully he will come back. In the meantime, if you'd like to treat us to some music then why not just turn up! David (recall David and Goliath) cheered up Saul with music when Saul felt troubled, so why not you to add joy to our Saturdays at the Foodbank!! It'll be appreciated!!

Client numbers have more than doubled (busiest Saturday recently had 40 families), so among these troubles let's share some Joy, just one Fruit of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) with us if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
