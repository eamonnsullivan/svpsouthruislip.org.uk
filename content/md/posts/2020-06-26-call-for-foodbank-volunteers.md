Like other aspects of our society, the SVP Team now needs to think of how we adjust ourselves to the new 'normal'. Our most active workstream at the moment is the Foodbank, and we have kept this open during the pandemic with an intentionally-small team acting as a Foodbank bubble. This strategy works well for short term issues but it removes team qualities such as resilience and sustainability, that are necessary for longer-term success.

We are now toying with the idea of building up a broader team of Foodbank volunteers again, but with conditions. Most importantly, volunteers would need to be:

1. outside the vulnerable age group
1. free of conditions that would make you particularly vulnerable to COVID-19
1. free of responsibilities for or regular interactions with a vulnerable person.

If these conditions work for you, and you are reasonably flexible with your Saturdays, from around 11:30-14:30, then why not have a think and get in touch! The new rota, if that is the path the team chooses, will probably start on Saturday, Sept. 5, allowing time for new volunteers to come to earlier sessions as a taster.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) with us if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
