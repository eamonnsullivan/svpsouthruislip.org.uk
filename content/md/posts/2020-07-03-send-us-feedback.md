Our SVP Monthly Meetings continue online to the usual schedule and that means July's meeting occurs on Zoom on Monday evening at 8pm. Even though our activities are constrained at present we always seem to have a lot to say!! That surely is a great sign of the strength of the Power of the Spirit within our blessed parish.

Our most active work streams at present include the food bank, bereavement care, phone-buddying and mentoring of the Young Persons SVP. If there are needs that we should be addressing, but that we have not got on our radar, then please do not hesitate to get in touch - it is sometimes difficult to see the bigger picture when you are too close to the detail so, rest assured, we will receive all feedback in a positive light!!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) with us if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
