The presence of the Holy Spirit in the parish is so tangible. Your incredible response to the Easter appeal for help, which raised over Â£3,500, has given us a super-solid foundation from which we are able to continue to help the needy who come to us.

Before the pandemic, our typical monthly visitor numbers to the Foodbank were 120+. In May, though, our monthly figure was a sobering 391. Each and every one was helped, because **you** helped us. Please accept our heartfelt thanks for your donations of funds, supplies and, above all, prayers.

We have also had an increase in the number of homeless visiting us and, because of your donations, we were able to supply some basic necessities such as sleeping bags and eating utensils. Thanks to your backing, we are now able to make plans to have items such as these on standby for the coming winter.

'Thank You', too, to the parishioners who stepped forward to help with the new Foodbank rota (launch date TBA) and also to the amazing team of home delivery volunteers who have been a rock for us since the start of lockdown.

As mentioned at the outset, the Holy Spirit is truly present at St Gregory's, Thank God.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need and just [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) with us if you know of someone who might need the help of the SVP.

God Bless!
