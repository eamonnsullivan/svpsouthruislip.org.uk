The annual, national SVP Awareness Campaign has now commenced and this year it is labelled 'Rise to the Challenge'. Throughout the world, including within our own parish, the SVP volunteers have been rising to the many challenges presented to us by the COVID19 pandemic. The Foodbank has remained open, home deliveries have been put in place, phone buddying continues at pace, hospital visits have been conducted safely, bereavement counselling continues, local issues of poverty have been addressed and twinnage activity with our sisters and brothers in the developing world have continued. The work of our SVP Conference is mirrored by thousands of SVP Conferences throughout the world.

The SVP is Rising to the Challenge of COVID19. Will you 'Rise to the Challenge' too? We need a constant flow of new volunteers and membership is open to all, so long as you have a heart of compassion. Please consider joining our team and, if the help of the SVP is needed, then please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
