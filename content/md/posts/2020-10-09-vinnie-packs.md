Around this time each year, the SVP conferences in the Westminster diocese work on a common project known as 'Vinnie Packs'. A 'Vinnie Pack' is basically a small bag that contains essential items for a homeless person in winter time. It contains such things as a thermal hat, thermal gloves, 2 pairs of thermal socks, toothbrush and paste, wetwipes, copy of Pavement magazine, a pen and an information sheet with useful numbers. 11,500 Vinnie packs need to be assembled ahead of winter.

Will you 'Rise to the Challenge' and help assemble these packs? The packing depot is at SEIDs, Empire Way, Wembley and various dates are available. Can you please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you are able to help - 'Many Hands make light work'.

Finally, please remain aware of need and if the help of the SVP is needed then please let us know.

God Bless!
