Our Young SVP Team have had an uphill struggle, having being launched a short few weeks before the pandemic and lockdown arrived. But, wow, have they 'Risen to the Challenge'!! From the outset of lockdown, they have been a core part of our food bank team each and every Saturday and their second initiative included a major clean up of the lane way between The Croft and Victoria Road in August.

They are now planning their third initiative: a cake sale after the 10am and noon masses next Sunday, November 1st. Please tell your friends and family and please give them as much support as you can. They will be putting all funds raised to assembling some Christmas gifts for the residents of our local Brackenbridge care home. The Young SVP had been visiting the residents every week for 18 months, but no visits have been possible since March. Thank you so much for your support.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need in the community and if the help of the SVP is needed then please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
