The clocks have fallen back and the nights are drawing in. This is the time of year when the SVP team ask you to please keep an extra eye out for any vulnerable neighbours in the community. Awareness is the key watchword. You never know: It could be that one phone call, or that one wave through the window, that makes all the difference to a lonely person. Loneliness claims too many people each year in the U.K. so let's try and do our little bit to help address the issue.

And always remember, if you, or someone you know, needs our company or help, then please do not hesitate to [reach out to us](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will always try our best.

God Bless!
