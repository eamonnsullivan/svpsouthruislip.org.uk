Despite the storm clouds and strong winds, there were so many rays of sunshine at the church last Sunday morning! The Young Persons SVP Team achieved great success with their cake sale and, thanks to your incredible support, they raised Â£510 for Christmas presents for the residents at Brackenbridge Care Home, on Victoria Road. They have not been able to visit the residents since March so they are hoping to make up for that with some lovely Christmas presents!

All young people are our future and your amazing support is a rock for them -- so thank you so much. They all returned home on Sunday full of the Holy Spirit!!

Finally, as we are once again in Lockdown, please remain aware of need around us and please [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best.

God Bless!
