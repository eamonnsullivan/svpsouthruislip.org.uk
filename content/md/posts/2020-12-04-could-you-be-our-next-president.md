As mentioned previously, the SVP Team is five years old next April. Our governance rules require that a new president needs to be in place by April and she or he will then appoint a new vice-president, treasurer and secretary. Those four will serve, please God, until April 2026.

Why not consider joining us and taking on one of these roles? Fresh faces and new outlooks have sustained us since 2016 so please do not be shy coming forward! Or, if you are not in a position to do so, then we ask you to please say a prayer for the team that a new team of officers will emerge in good time.

Finally, and most importantly, please remain aware of need around us and if the help of your SVP Team is needed, then [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
