With the festive season rapidly approaching, the food bank is as busy as ever. The holidays can be especially hard on families who are struggling, and the global pandemic is making it harder still.

As always, we rely on your donations. Items we most regularly require are listed [here](../../pages-output/foodbank/#donations). In addition to these, please consider donating seasonal items that may be a treat for those in need, such as the following:

 * Christmas Cake
 * Chocolates
 * Biscuits
 * Snacks (twiglets, nuts etc.)

This year, our SVP volunteers are putting together Christmas stockings for the children of families who have needed our help. Families with more than 150 children have visited in just the last few months. Please consider donating items that could go in a stocking, such as the following:

 * Chocolate coins
 * Chocolate Santa's
 * Tubes of sweets
 * Small selection boxes

Thank you, as always, for your generous support!
