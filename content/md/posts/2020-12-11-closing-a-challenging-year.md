Last Monday evening the SVP team held their final monthly meeting of the year, a year like no other! Guided by the Holy Spirit, and sustained by your prayers and encouragement, we have been able to maintain and adapt most of our activities during the pandemic.

The launch of our Young Persons SVP Team in March has been one of our highlights for 2020 and this group has now grown to 13 members. Some of these members formed the backbone of the Foodbank Team since the start of the first lockdown. In this year, of all years, we ask you to pray for these young people, and all young people, as we continue to journey through the challenges of COVID-19.

And finally, as ever, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and if the help of your SVP Team is needed then [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/). We will always try our best.

God Bless!
