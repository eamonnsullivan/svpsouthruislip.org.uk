This has been one of the easiest news items to write this year! On behalf of the SVP Team, the Young Persons SVP, the wider team of food bank volunteers and our team of 'temporary' members who continue to do our home delivery service, we would like to say a huge 'Thank You' to all of you, our bedrock.

Your spiritual and financial support and your continual encouragement of the work we do is the fuel that keeps us going! Your fabulous response to our Easter Appeal, the Young Persons Cake Sale and the recent sale of religious items, was humbling to us and affirmed that the Holy Spirit is a true reality in our parish. Please pray that this will always be the case and please have a very Holy Christmas and a very Happy New Year.

And finally, as ever, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and if the help of your SVP Team is needed then [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
