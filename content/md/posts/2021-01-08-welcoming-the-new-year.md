Firstly, the SVP Team wishes you all a very happy New Year and, with your support, we look forward to continuing to help our sisters and brothers in need.

We held our January monthly meeting on Monday evening and, once again, it was a full agenda with some great progress reported. Importantly, we made progress on finding a new president, who needs to be in place by the end of April for the next 5-year term. More details to follow, once formalities are finalised!

This time of year is very busy for the food bank and we are very grateful for all your help with donations, especially the cup-a-soups -- a warm drink is worth its weight in gold on these cold Saturdays!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and if the help of your SVP Team is needed then [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
