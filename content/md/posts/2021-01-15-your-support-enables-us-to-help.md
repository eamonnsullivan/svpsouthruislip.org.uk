As we journey through winter, and the pandemic, we see a continual demand for our help. Because of your support and encouragement, we have always been able to say 'Yes' to these requests for help and, please God, this will always be the case.

At present, our busiest work streams are the [food bank](../../pages-output/foodbank/), home deliveries, phone-buddying, including with our sisters and brothers [in detention](../../pages-output/refugee/), and our [bereavement care](../../pages-output/bereavement/). We are supported in some of these activities by our Young Persons SVP Team, the success of which was our brightest spot in 2020!

While much of our help focuses on physical need, we are conscious that an equal focus is required on spiritual need. Please pray for those we help and your prayers, combined with your ongoing support, will be a winning formula!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and if the help of your SVP Team is needed then [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
