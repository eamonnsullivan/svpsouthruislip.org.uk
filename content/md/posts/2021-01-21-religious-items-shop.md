As our first initiative of 2021, the SVP Team are hoping to start a religious items shop/stall in the porch of the church. We are currently identifying some stock and, with the help of the Young Persons SVP, we hope to start after the masses on Feb. 6 and 7. The Young Persons SVP are coming up with a name for the shop/stall, but if you have any ideas then we are all ears!!

As mentioned last week, the SVP's mission is to provide spiritual help as well as physical help so, please God, this new initiative may have, as yet, unseen benefits. The stock is likely to include statues, rosary beads/rings, prayer books and cards and other such items. Please spend a moment browsing -- social-distanced, of course -- once it is all set up. And please spread the word!!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and if the help of your SVP Team is needed then [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
