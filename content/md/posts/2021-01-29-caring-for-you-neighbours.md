The recent cold spell reminds us that winter is still with us for a few weeks yet. The lengthening evenings are a sign that Spring is coming, though. Until it arrives, and even when it does, maybe you could keep an eye on your elderly, vulnerable or lonely neighbours. A few social-distanced words, or a knock on the window, can be just what is needed and, funnily enough, it will do your spirit good too! We are blessed to live in such a caring parish, the evidence of which is seen by us each Saturday at the Foodbank, so, 'Thank You' in advance for dropping in on your neighbours.

And, when you do, and you identify a case of need, then please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team -- we will always do our best to help.

God Bless!
