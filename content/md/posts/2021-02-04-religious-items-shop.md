This weekend you hopefully noticed our first initiative of 2021 in the porch of the church -- our new Religious Items shop/stall! We still need a proper name for it so please don't be shy with your suggestions!

We will set up the shop on the first weekend of each month to start with and, on those weekends, it will be open after each Sunday Mass -- from the 5:30pm Mass on Saturday evening and after all masses on Sunday. If you are looking for an item that is not on display, then just have a word with us and we will try and source it for you. The Young Persons SVP will be running this shop/stall with us so please Thank God for such a lovely example of the Holy Spirit in action in our parish.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
