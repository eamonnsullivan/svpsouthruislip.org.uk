The reflective Season of Lent commences on Wednesday, Ash Wednesday. Are you thinking of giving up something for Lent, or maybe doing something new?

If you are thinking of doing something new then why not consider joining our SVP Team? We do a lovely variety of things and are always in need of new volunteers so that we can remain a sustainable team. Our initiatives include the [Foodbank](../../pages-output/foodbank/), [Bereavement Care](../../pages-output/bereavement/), Phone-buddying (in place of visits) with the local [Care Home](../../pages-output/care-home-visits/), with the [housebound](../../pages-output/home-visits/) and with those being held in [detention](../../pages-output/refugee/), [Young Persons SVP](../../pages-output/mentoring/) and Mini-Vinnies (primary school ages).

Does one of these interest you? Or is there another initiative, that you would like to start? Why not have a think, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to explore further -- you'll be joining a wonderful team!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
