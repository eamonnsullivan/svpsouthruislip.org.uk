The SVP Team has been going for almost five years now, and your encouragement and support has been a huge factor in sustaining us.

Last week was another example of this when you responded so generously to the appeal for mobile phones for those we [visit](../../pages-output/refugee/) at the Colnbrook and Harmondsworth immigration detention centres. We work through the [Jesuit Refugee Service](https://www.jrsuk.net/) (JRS) when visiting those held in detention and we will shortly deliver the phones that you have donated to the JRS. Rest assured of their thanks and prayers for you, and for all at St Gregory's. The phones will then swiftly make their way to those in need, and be assured, also, of their thanks and prayers.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
