The SVP Team meet on Monday evening for our monthly meeting and this meeting is a milestone for us! The team will be 5 years old in April and, so, to comply with good goverance and SVP Rules we need to have a new President in place by then. Once elected, the new President will then appoint a Vice-President, Treasurer and Secretary.

The election of the new President will take place at Monday's meeting so please say a prayer for all the team. Please God, this process will then place the SVP Team in a great position to face the next 5 years with Faith, Hope and Love. If you would like to join us on the next part of our journey then why not get in touch!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
