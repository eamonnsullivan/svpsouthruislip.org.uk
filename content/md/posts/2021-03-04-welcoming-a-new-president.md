With the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the SVP Team elected its new president on Monday evening! On April 26, Tracy Tierney will be our new leader and there is no doubt that, with your support, Tracy will be a fantastic success over the next five years.

For example, our first initative of 2021, our religious items stall named 'Gifted', sprang from one of Tracy's ideas for the New Year. Gifted will be open this weekend after all the Sunday masses -- 5:30pm, 10am, 12noon and 6pm -- and we really hope you enjoy the range of items that we have procured. Please have a look, and remember that the plan is that Gifted will be open on the first weekend of each month.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
