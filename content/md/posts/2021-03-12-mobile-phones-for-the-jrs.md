We support both the mission of the SVP, and that of the Jesuit Refugee Service (the JRS), by visiting (phone buddying at present) our brothers and sisters held in detention. At the monthly JRS meeting on Tuesday evening, the news of the mobile devices that you recently donated was joyously received. Our Young Persons SVP members completed the checking and resetting of all the devices and so these should be in the hands of those being held in detention very soon.

Please pray for those in detention and, most importantly, for our government, that they will be guided by the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit when formulating its policies on the treatment of our brothers and sisters in the unfortunate situation of being a refugee.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
