One of our new initiatives for 2021 has been the launch of Gifted, our religious items shop/stall. It operates after all the Sunday masses on the first Sunday of each month -- 5:30pm Saturday and 10am, 12noon and 6pm on Sunday. So far it has operated in February and March and your support has been just brilliant! We never realised that our congregation missed a religious items shop/stall so much. Please God the SVP, with the help of the Young Persons SVP, will be able to keep this initiative running in to the long term!

As the first Sunday of April is Easter, the pinnacle of the Church year, we are going to move Gifted to Palm Sunday instead. If you are looking for Easter cards, or beautiful religious gifts such as rosary beads, crucifixes, medals, candles etc. then look no further than Gifted!!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
