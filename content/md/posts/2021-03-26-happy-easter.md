The hope that the SVP Team is able to offer to those we help is beautifully reflected in the hope that we all experience through the message of our Risen Lord on Easter morning.

Without your help, though, the hope being offered by the SVP Team would not be possible. So, at this lovely time of year, we would like to wish you all a very Happy and Holy Easter and say a huge 'Thank You' for sustaining us through your encouragement, feedback and support.

'Gifted', our religious items stall, is open this weekend and we hope you enjoy the selection of gifts on offer! No Easter eggs though!!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
