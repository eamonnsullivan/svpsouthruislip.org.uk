We had our final monthly meeting of the current SVP five-year term on Monday evening and so, from April 26th, our new president, Tracy Tierney, takes over the reins! In accordance with the SVP's governance principles, Tracy has appointed a new leadership team for the coming term. This team consists of Vice-President Paul O'Regan, Secretary Leanne Menezes and Treasurer Linda Donoghue.

The team of six that embarked in April 2016 has now been transformed in to an amazing team of 17 members. Where will the Holy Spirit lead us to by 2026?! Please accept our thanks for all your support over the last five years and please pray for the whole SVP Team as we embark on the next stage of our journey.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP team if our help is needed.

God Bless!
