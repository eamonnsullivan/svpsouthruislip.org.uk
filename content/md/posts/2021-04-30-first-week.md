This is my first week as our SVP president. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Paul O'Regan for everything he has done over the past five years and I hope I can continue in his footsteps and grow the SVP on the great foundations he has built. Paul, as the vice president, will be there to guide me if I go off course.

This weekend our SVP shop, GIFTED, will be open at the back of the church, or if the weather is good we may even venture outside. We have a variety of religious items, including statues, candles, greeting cards and rosary beads, to name but a few. If there is something specific you are looking for, or if you have any suggestions, please let us know and we will try our best to find it for you.

As you all know the SVP has many arms and legs and we have tried to remain operational during the pandemic. If you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help

God Bless!
