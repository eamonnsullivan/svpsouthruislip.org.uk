As you know the SVP shop, GIFTED, opened this weekend. Your support was amazing and I would like to thank all of the parishioners for their continued support of the SVP. When we open in June we will make sure we have a lot of items for First Holy Communions as many of our little parishioners take this step on their religious journey.

As we all start to see some of our restrictions lifting gradually, the SVP is looking forward to getting back to some kind of normal. This would enable us to restart some of our activities.  To do this it would be wonderful to get some new volunteers. If you could see yourself getting involved in any of the SVP activities please come and chat to one of the SVP members and we will tell you all about it.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help

God Bless!
