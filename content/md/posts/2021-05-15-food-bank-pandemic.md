The SVP has many initiatives that we run at the moment, many of which we have been unable to run effectively due to the pandemic. However, the food bank is one area where we have grown and the number of families we are now serving has increased exponentially.

There are two sides to the food bank at St Gregory's: On one side, the SVP are a distribution centre for Hillingdon Foodbank, a separate charity based in Uxbridge. Families come and collect a limited number of pre-packed bags of food that are delivered to us each week. On the other side, there is St Gregory's food bank, supplied by parish and community donations. When a person does not qualify for a Hillingdon Foodbank parcel then we use these to assist those who are struggling to make ends meet and buy food for their families.

Last weekend we sent food home for 61 families, made up of 132 adults and 111 children. Two dozen families received food from Hillingdon Foodbank and 37 families from St Gregory's food bank

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help

God Bless!
