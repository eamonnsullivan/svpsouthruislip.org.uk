The SVP started a bereavement care group in the middle of 2019. After our volunteers received the necessary training, we opened our doors on the first Wednesday of every month in the church hall. We offered those who attended a cup of tea or coffee and a friendly face to chat about any bereavement issues that they wished, whether they be new or old issues. If you or someone you know could use a friendly ear, give the bereavement care group a call on 07562475720.

The pandemic put paid to our meetings in the hall. However, the bereavement team has kept this service running by having telephone meetings with those who asked. We currently have a bereavement team of three who call people on a regular basis.

As some pandemic restrictions are lifted, the SVP are pleased to announce that we can reopen our bereavement care group in the church hall on the first Wednesday of every month, starting June 2, from 10:30 to noon. Please come and join us for a cup of tea or coffee and a chat!

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help

God Bless!
