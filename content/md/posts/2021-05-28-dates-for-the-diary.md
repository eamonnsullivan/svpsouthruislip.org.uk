A few dates for your diary:

- Wednesday, June 2, from 10.30am to noon.

This will be the first face-to-face session for the bereavement care group since we went into lockdown in March 2020.  The team will be in the church hall. Please come and join them for a cup of tea or coffee and a chat. Whether your bereavement is recent or maybe older, we are here to listen.

If you can not make the session the team is available on the telephone: Call 07562475720 and leave a message, a member of the bereavement care group will call you back.

- Saturday and Sunday, June 5 and 6

The SVP shop, Gifted, will be open for business after each weekend mass. Our focus this month is the young parishioners who will soon be taking their first Holy Communion. We have a selection of gifts and cards. In addition, we have a selection of rosary beads, statues and many other items.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help
