B-Attitude, our young person's SVP group in the parish, is for members between 14 and 18 years of age. These youngsters are full of ideas to help in the community.

Last year they were involved in a bake sale which raised funds for elderly residents of a local care home. This week they are out in force again -- doing a spot of gardening around the parish's Garden of Our Lady. They had some help from volunteers from HSBC in Eastcote. Pop over and take a look at what has been achieved. There is still lots to do, but this is a good start!

If you would like to get involved in this active group please call us for more information or come along to the next meeting on Friday 25th June at 5.30pm in the church hall.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help.
