Moved by the plight of refugees, members of the SVP volunteer with the Jesuit Refugee Service to visit people detained at the immigration removal centres near Heathrow airport. After training in January 2019, we began visiting inmates at the Harmondsworth and Colnbrook facilities. Up to 1,000 men are held here, often for weeks, months or even years while courts consider their claims for asylum. When they are bailed, they're sent into communities with little or no support. They are often traumatised by war and trafficking. Our job is to visit them, see them as fellow human beings and accompany them on their difficult and lonely journey.

Four members of our team are now involved. The role has changed during the pandemic, to phone support instead of in-person visits. But slowly we're starting to be allowed in to the centres again. We are also often called upon to provide clothing and other material support. Most recently, our parish responded generously to a request for mobile phones to those who have been released to the community.

If this work interests you, talk to us and we can tell you more about it.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help.
