Since starting the SVP at St Gregory's, we have had at our core visiting the housebound, sick and lonely people in our parish and the community. The SVP visits people in their homes on a one-to-one basis. During the pandemic, due to lockdown and many of our friends shielding, we reverted to phone calls. While it kept us in touch, it was not the same as talking face-to-face.

I am happy to say we can now resume visits, so long as we stick to the rule of six, or meet in the garden if it is a nice day.

We currently see around 16 people, who have become friends to us. Some are ill. Some have lost loved ones and are feeling lonely. Some just need someone to talk to who perhaps isn't family. Whatever the need, we pop in, have a cup of tea and a good chat.

If you or anyone you know would like a visit please [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) the SVP. We would love to see you.
