I cannot believe a month has gone by, but it has, and next weekend the SVP shop will be open for business again. We have listened to your requests and have statues of St Anthony, St Jude and the Holy Family. Also by request, we have more candles with various designs and a selection of religious greetings cards. That's just a few things there to whet your appetite and there is so much more. We look forward to seeing you! If there is anything you are looking for, please do let us know and we will try our best to get it for you.

We will be having our monthly meeting on Monday, July 5. We always welcome new members, especially as we hope to come out of lockdown and get back to some kind of normality with the foodbank and care home visits. If this is something that interests you please come along to the meeting, which is held in the church hall, or [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/) for more information.
