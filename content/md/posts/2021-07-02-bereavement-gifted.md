The Bereavement Care group will be open as usual in the church hall this Wednesday 7th July. Bridget and the team will welcome you with a cup of tea or coffee and friendly ear so you can chat freely about your loved ones who are no longer with us. The group will meet right after 10am mass until 12 noon. This is only the second time we have been able to meet face to face since the lockdown. Please pop along and meet the team. Everyone is welcome.

Gifted, our SVP group's religious items shop, is also open for business this weekend. You will find us at the back of the church, in the porch, with a selection of candles, statues, rosary beads and much more. If there is something you are looking for and we do not have it, please have a chat to us and we will do our best to source it for you.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community please  do not hesitate to [contact](../../pages-output/contact/) your SVP Team and we will do our best to help.

God Bless, Tracy
