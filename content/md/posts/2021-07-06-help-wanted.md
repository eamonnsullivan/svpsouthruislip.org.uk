Another month has passed and the SVP and the B-Attitude group have been busy. We have lots of things in the pipeline as we prepare to come out of lockdown and would love some extra volunteers to help us.

FOOD BANK: There are many areas in which you can help at the food bank, such as meeting and greeting the visitors, helping with their needs, packing bags and stocking the store room. We are a friendly bunch and would welcome all new volunteers.

SVP: The main SVP group needs help with our many activities, including supporting refugees, visiting members of the parish and community and helping in the SVP shop. We also have a few social activities planned for when we come out of lockdown and we could use a hand.

B-ATTITUDE: If you are between 14 and 18 years old and would like to join our young person's group, please have a word with Fr Paulo or email us. During lockdown we managed a cake sale, made gifts for care home residents and gave the garden by Our Lady a bit of a makeover -- imagine what we can do out of lockdown!

If any of these activities interest you, or if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community, please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).
