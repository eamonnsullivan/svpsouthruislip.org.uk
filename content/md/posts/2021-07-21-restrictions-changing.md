With restrictions lifted, the SVP has looked at our activities and, like many things, some will adjust and some will stay the same.

At the food bank, we will continue to wear face masks, and we will continue to meet people face to face, as long as both parties are comfortable with that. We are hoping to resume care home visits soon and the immigration detention centre has started to allow face to face meetings once more. Our religious shop, Gifted, has remained open during lockdown restrictions and will be open again next weekend, in the porch at the back of the church.

If you or anyone you know would like a visit, please [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/). We would love to see you.
