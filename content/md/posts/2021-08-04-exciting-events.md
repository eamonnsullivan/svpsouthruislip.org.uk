A big thank you to everyone who supported the SVP shop, Gifted, this past weekend. As always, it was lovely to chat with you and get ideas of what to stock going forward.

We have had our monthly meeting for both the SVP and the B-Attitude group and we have some exciting events taking place this month: The B-Attitude group for young people will lead a garden day and tidy up around the statue of Our Lady on Wednesday August 18. There will also be a car wash later in the month where, for a donation, your car can be washed while you are at Mass. Details to follow.

As always, if you or anyone you know would like a visit, please [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/). We would love to see you.
