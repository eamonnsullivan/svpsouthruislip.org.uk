The past year and a half have been hard for many. We've lost family and friends and our finances have been squeezed as never before. The SVP is here to help, not just "out there" in the community, but also among our neighbours and fellow parishioners.

Over the past few weeks we have become aware of parishioners who have needed a little help and we have been able to assist. It takes courage to ask for help. Rest assured that this will always be handled in a non-judgemental, confidential and respectful manner.

There are many way to [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/), either by email, by phone, or if you feel more comfortable chatting face to face, you can always find us at the food bank on a Saturday between 12 noon and 2pm or at mass. Fr Paulo will point you in the right direction. We look forward to hearing from you!
