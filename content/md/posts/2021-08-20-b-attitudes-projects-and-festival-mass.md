The B-Attitude group has been busy! The B-Attitudes held a gardening day on Wednesday and did a great job clearing the area next to the parish office. The B-Attitudes are also having a car wash this weekend, Aug. 22, during the 10am and 12 noon masses. You are invited to bring your car for us to wash while you are at Mass, with a suggested donation of Â£5. All funds raised will be used to fund projects to help those in the community. Currently we are fundraising to buy Christmas gifts for residents of a local care home.

September is SVP Awareness Month, with the Feast of St Vincent de Paul on Sept. 27. We are planning our first ever SVP Festival Mass on Friday, Sept. 10, at 7pm. ALL WELCOME! The Festival Mass is our opportunity to give thanks to God for the gift of Saint Vincent, to give thanks for all those who help the SVP and to pray for all those who are helped by the SVP. PLEASE COME ALONG AND CELEBRATE THIS LOVELY MASS!

As always, if you or anyone you know would like a visit, please [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/). We would love to see you.
