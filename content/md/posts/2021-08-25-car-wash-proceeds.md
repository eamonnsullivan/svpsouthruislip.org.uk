Our B-Attitude group were very busy this past weekend, washing cars on Sunday while you were at mass. We would like to thank you enormously for your continued support. We raised in excess of Â£450, which will be used to purchase Christmas gifts for residents of Brackenbridge House care home.

Before lockdown, a group of teenagers from our parish would visit the care home each week, chatting to residents and playing cards and dominoes. The care home is currently only allowing family to visit, so the gifts are our way of letting them know we still care. We also deliver DVDs of the mass each week, so they have a connection to St Gregory the Great.

Please keep the residents in your prayers, as they have had a tough time during the pandemic.

If you or anyone you know would like a visit, please [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/).
