Our first ever SVP Festival Mass at St. Gregory the Great Parish will be held at 7pm on Friday, Sept. 10. Please join us as we give thanks to all those who have aided the SVP's many activities over the past five years, and pray for all those we help.

Also, the SVP shop will be open this weekend before and after mass on Saturday Evening and all masses on Sunday. We have a selection of religious items and greeting cards.

As always, if you or anyone you know would like a visit please [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
