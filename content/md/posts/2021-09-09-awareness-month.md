September is SVP awareness month. The SVP was founded in 1833 by a group of students in Paris. Inspired by the example of St Vincent de Paul, they set about serving the poor of the city. In 1844, the first group in Britain was started in London. Here at St Gregory the Great, we continue in the spirit of those students to serve those in need in our community.

We would like to thank all of those who get involved in any way at all. Without our volunteers, and the generosity of the parish, we would not be able to continue to serve those in need in the way that we do.

We have all been challenged as a result of Covid-19 and need your help more than ever. There are families short of food, lonely people who need a friend, those facing illness and many other situations. Please join us and work to help them in any way you can, be it packing food, collecting donations or phoning someone for a chat.  There are many ways in which you can help.

If you would like more information about helping the SVP, please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
