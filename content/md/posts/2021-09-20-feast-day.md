September is SVP Awareness Month, with the feast day of St Vincent de Paul on Sept. 27. The SVP and B-Attitudes are very active groups in our parish, but not everyone is aware of what we do. We would like to take this opportunity to answer your questions and fill in any gaps you may have.

If you are thinking about joining the SVP, or one of our volunteer groups, or even if you need help from us, come join us for tea, coffee and a chat after every mass this weekend (Saturday 5:30pm and all Sunday masses).

If you cannot make it this weekend but would like to know more, please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless
Tracy
