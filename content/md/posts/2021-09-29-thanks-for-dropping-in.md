I would like to thank everyone who popped in for a cup of coffee and a chat over last weekend. It was lovely to meet you and great to see such interest in what we do. I look forward to seeing you all at our various activities over the next few weeks.

Our next SVP meeting is on Monday, Oct. 4, at 8pm in the church hall. Please feel free to join us and see what we are up to.

Our SVP shop is open this weekend. We have a lovely selection of religious items and cards. We look forward to seeing you and please let us know if you are looking for something specific and we will do our best to get it for you.

The Bereavement Care group -- Bridget and the team -- will be in the hall on Wednesday, Oct. 6, after 10am mass.  Please drop in for a cup of tea and a chat.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.

God Bless
Tracy
