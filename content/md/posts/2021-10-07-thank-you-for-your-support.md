As you know the SVP shop, GIFTED, opened this weekend. Once again your support was amazing and I would like to thank all of the parishioners for their continued support of the SVP.

Thank you too for your support of the foodbank. We do anticipate things picking up a bit with the furlough scheme coming to an end, we could see more people out of work. Please keep all those who feel the need to use the foodbank in your prayers.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.


God Bless, Tracy
