For many of us, life is slowly returning to normal. Some of us are even heading into work, if only a few days a week. But for many of our visitors at the food bank, queuing up on a Saturday morning has become their normal and they do not yet see a way out. The loss of a job, or the loss of a loved one and ever-increasing bills are putting a strain on the household budget. We continue to help around 50 families on a weekly basis and your donations go a long way in ensuring that these families can put food on the table.

Thank you for your continued support. As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.

God Bless!
