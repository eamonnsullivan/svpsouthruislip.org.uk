The SVP Bereavement Care group meets on the first Wednesday of every month, so why not pop into the hall after mass on Wednesday morning for a cup of tea and a chat with Bridget and her team? If you cannot make it and you would like to chat about a loss, then you can contact Bridget on 07562475720.

Next weekend, Nov. 6-7, the SVP shop will be open in the porch. We are excited to let you know our first lot of Christmas stock has arrived and will be on sale -- everything from cards to Advent candles.

As always, if you come across anyone in need of our help in the community, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.

God Bless!
