As the nights draw in and the weather is getting colder, please remember to keep a look out for your elderly or vulnerable neighbours. It is the time of year where we do not venture beyond our front door. There are many people who live alone and may not have many visitors. If you have time, please knock on their door from time to time and make sure they have everything they need.

The SVP can help with visits, phone calls or even getting shopping or a prescription. If there is something we can do to help, no matter how big or small, we will do our best to assist.

If you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
