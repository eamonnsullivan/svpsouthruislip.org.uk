The SVP has partnered with HSBC on a few occasions this year: Staff members of the bank have volunteered at the food bank and participated in both of our gardening days with the B-Attitudes, providing equipment such as gloves, forks and trimmers. They have again been generous and have funded the re-carpeting of the small room adjacent to the parish hall. This has been a great partnership and we only see it going from strength to strength in the future. Please join us in thanking HSBC for their generosity.

As Christmas is fast approaching, the SVP is looking to put stockings together for children whose parents have found the need to use our food bank. To do this we need a little help. If you could add any of the following when you are shopping, it would be greatly appreciated: selection boxes, chocolate coins, chocolate Santas, large tubes of sweets or anything you think is appropriate.

Please continue to watch out for your elderly neighbours and as always if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
