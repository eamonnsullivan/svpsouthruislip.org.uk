Winter is a desperate time for anyone living on the streets. The St Vincent de Paul Society (SVP) is tackling this crisis by producing thousands of packs of essential items for homeless people. The kits, known as Vinnie Packs, contain a thermal hat, two pairs of thermal socks, thermal gloves, toothpaste, toothbrush, wet wipes, a pen, a Pavement magazine and an information sheet.

Our B-Attitude group along with some of our SVP members spent Sunday afternoon putting some of these packs together. In four hours, they managed to make 750 packs -- a great achievement! In total the SVP will make 11,500 Vinnie Packs to be distributed to the homeless across England and Wales.

The SVP shop, Gifted, will be open this weekend. As well as Christmas cards and gifts, we have produced a beautiful calendar of our church, St Gregory the Great. Calendars will be on sale this weekend at Â£5 each.

As always, If you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
