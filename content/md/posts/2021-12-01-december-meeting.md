The SVP at St Gregory's is a very active group. Our activities include the food bank, bereavement care, the SVP shop, home visits and support for refugees. We meet on the first Monday of every month, at 8pm in the church hall. If you would like to see what we are about, please join us at our December meeting on Monday. We try to be finished by 9pm.

The SVP shop, Gifted, will be open this weekend after every mass. We have a selection of Christmas cards,  decorations and the St Gregory's calendar, as well as other religious items.

Please continue to watch out for your elderly neighbours and, as always, if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
