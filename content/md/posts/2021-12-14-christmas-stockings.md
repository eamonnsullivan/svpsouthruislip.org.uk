Your SVP shop, Gifted, will be open after all masses this weekend. It is the last time we will be open this year and still have some Christmas items for sale, along with may other pieces.

Thanks you to all who have donated sweets for the children's Christmas stockings. These will be handed out at the food bank this weekend. We hope to ensure that many children have a little extra under the tree this Christmas.

As we celebrate Christmas in a warm home surrounded by our families, spare a thought for those that are at home alone or maybe do not have a home. Let's pray for a better tomorrow for those people in those situations.

I would like to wish you all a Blessed Christmas.

God Bless!
