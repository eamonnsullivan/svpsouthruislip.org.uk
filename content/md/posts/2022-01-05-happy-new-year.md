Happy New Year!

As I look back to what St Gregory's SVP and B-Attitudes achieved last year while dealing with Covid restrictions, it makes me excited to see what we can do this year.

Our food bank has continued throughout the restrictions and we're now adding a new service: The Disablement Association of Hillingdon (DASH) has launched a new project, funded by the Greater London Authority, to tackle poverty and hardship for people living in our borough. A representative will join us at the food bank on the first Saturday of the month, offering advice and support with issues such as benefits, debt management, immigration and housing difficulties.

As always if you come across anyone in need, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
