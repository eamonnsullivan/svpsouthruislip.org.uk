The B-Attitudes would like to thank you for all of the stamps that have been dropped in the box in the church porch. It is wonderful to see so much support for the Royal National Institute of Blind People. Christmas is a great time for getting stamps, but we will keep the collection going and see where it takes us.

The SVP also held their first meeting of the year on Monday, where we welcomed a new member. If you would like to join our group, or if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).
