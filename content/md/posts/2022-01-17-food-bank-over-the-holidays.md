Our food bank continued to serve many families over the holidays, thanks to your generous donations and the support of organisations such as Hillingdon Foodbank and FareShare.

On Dec. 18, we had one of our busiest sessions, with more than 60 families served. As well as food, we gave out around 50 hampers with extra goodies donated by Hillingdon Foodbank and the Fassnidge Memorial Trust. We also distributed 120 Christmas stockings to the children. At the last minute, we received a generous donation of store gift cards, allowing us to further ease the pressure on these families.

Our normal opening day is Saturday, so we were closed for Christmas and New Year's this year. We held an extra session on New Year's Eve. It was not as busy as usual, but we did see many people and felt it was well worth opening.

We are now back to normal and as busy as ever. Every week we update a list of needs on the notice board in the parish porch. Your continued support is much appreciated.

As always if you come across anyone in need, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
