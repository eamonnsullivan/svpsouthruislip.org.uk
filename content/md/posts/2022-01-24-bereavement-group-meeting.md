The SVP Bereavement Care group has been in operation for about four years now. How time flies! They meet in the church hall on the first Wednesday of every month, so why not pop into the hall after mass on Wednesday morning for a cup of tea and a chat with Bridget and her team? Alternatively, you can leave a voice message on 07562 412 986 and a member will get back to you within a day.

Bridget and the team meet about 10 people every month and also follow up with telephone calls to those that would like that.

As always, If you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
