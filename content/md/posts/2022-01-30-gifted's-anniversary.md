The SVP's shop, Gifted, will be open this weekend, after all weekend Masses. It has been a year since we opened for the first time, and we would like to thank you for your support of the shop. The funds we raise helps us continue the work that we do.

Like last year, we will have everything to help you celebrate St Patrick's Day -- cards, statues, rosary beads, key rings and much more. In addition we have a few things for Mothers day too. Please stop by and have a browse. Do let us know if you are looking for something specific and we will try and get it for you.

As always, If you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to contact your SVP Team and we will do our best to help: 07563 775 777, info@svpsouthruislip.org.uk or www.svpsouthruislip.org.uk.
