During the first lockdown, the SVP started sending DVDs and CDs of Masses held at our Parish. These were sent to many parishioners who, due to shielding or lack of Internet access, were unable to participate in our services. We are continuing to do this and currently send DVDs to parishioners and two care homes in the area: Brackenbridge House and Whitby Dene. Care homes are still restricting visitors, so this is our way of letting them know that we at St Gregory's have not forgotten about them.

If you or someone you know would like to receive a weekly copy of our Mass please contact the SVP: 07563 775 777, info@svpsouthruislip.org.uk or www.svpsouthruislip.org.uk.
