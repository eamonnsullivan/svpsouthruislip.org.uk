When refugees are on the move, their most precious item is often their smartphone. These devices are wrapped in several layers of bin liners and tape and kept closer than any other possession, including food and clothes. They are a lifeline to families back home, via apps such as WhatsApp and FaceTime. The phones also give refugees access to vital news as they pass through dangerous and war-torn countries.Â These devices often get seized or destroyed en-route, adding to the distress of people already fleeing for their lives.

A year ago, St Gregory's responded generously when the SVP asked for old smartphones and tablets. The Jesuit Refugee Service, which we help support, said dozens of these devices were distributed to people awaiting immigration appeals and were gratefully received. Recently, some more devices have been donated, so we'll be bringing them to the JRS next month.

If you have old smart phones or tablets that you could donate, please [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/).
