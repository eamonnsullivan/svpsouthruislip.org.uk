A couple of weeks ago, I had a call from the president of the SVP conference at The Most Sacred Heart in Ruislip, Sue Jeffrey. We met for coffee with open minds and loads of ideas. Sacred Heart really wanted to help with our activities where they could. Their first thought was the food bank. Sue spent a day there and had a speedy introduction to what we do. She went away with many ideas of where they could help and soon put her first thought into action. Sacred Heart has had an appeal for cleaning products and we will be receiving their donation in the next few days to distribute at the food bank. I hope and believe this will be a great partnership where, working together within the SVP framework, we will be able to achieve great things. The SVP at St Gregory's and Sacred Heart will continue to be separate conferences and come together where an opportunity is seen.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
