As St Patrick's Day is fast approaching, we are well underway with the preparations to celebrate with a bingo evening on Saturday, March 19. Why not get your friends and family together for what should be a fun evening. You may even win!

The SVP shop will be open this weekend after all masses on Saturday evening and Sunday. We have stocked up, not only for St Patrick's Day (March 17), but also for St Joseph's Day (March 19), Mothers Day (March 27) and Easter (April 17). Please stop by for a browse and a chat.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
