Planning is well underway for the SVP's St Patrick's Day Bingo Evening, to be held in the church hall on Saturday, March 19. We will open the doors at 6.15 pm, with eyes down at 7 pm.

Bingo will be the centre of attention, but we will have light snacks on the table, an SVP raffle with some great prizes, and the bar will be open with beer, wine, soft drinks and, of course, Guinness and Irish coffee. While this will raise some funds for the SVP, the main aim is to welcome everyone back to socialising in the parish.

We are really looking forward to the evening and I hope you can join us. You never know, with the luck of the Irish, you might just win the jackpot!
