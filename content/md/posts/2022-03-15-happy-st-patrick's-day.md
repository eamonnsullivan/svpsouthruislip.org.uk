Happy St Patrick's Day! I hope you had a great one and are able to join our St Patrick's bingo evening on Saturday, March 19. We at the SVP are excited to host the first social evening of the parish since we locked down due to Covid. If you do not manage to join us this time, not to worry, we will have more events later in the year.

Funds raised from the bingo evening will help to fund activities undertaken by the SVP -- the food bank, our bereavement care group, support for the homeless and visiting residents of care homes, refugees, the sick, housebound and lonely.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
