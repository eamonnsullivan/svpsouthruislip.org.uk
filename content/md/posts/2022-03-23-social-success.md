What a great time we had at the St Patrick's Day Bingo evening on Saturday! There are lots people to thank: from the people who helped organise, to those who helped on the night, to the group who set up and tidied at the end. And, of course, thanks to all of you who came and joined in. I think I speak for all when i say what a great night it was. It was lovely to see people getting out and socialising again.

The SVP has many other things in the pipeline, so watch the newsletter for the next event in the diary.

We continue to support the community in our many activities. As always, if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
