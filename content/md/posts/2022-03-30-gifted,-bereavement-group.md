The SVP's shop, Gifted, will be open this weekend. We still have a few things for Easter and have started stocking First Holy Communion cards and gifts, as well as lots of generic gifts and cards. Do let us know if you are looking for something specific and we will try and get it for you.

The SVP Bereavement Care group will meet on Wednesday, April 6. Why not pop in to the hall after 10am mass and meet Bridget and the team over a cup of tea or coffee.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
