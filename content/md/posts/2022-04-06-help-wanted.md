The SVP is looking for additional help. If you speak a foreign language, and can spare an hour or so on occasional Saturdays, we would really appreciate your assistance. We are also looking for drivers for occasional deliveries. If you have a small van or larger car, that would be perfect.

There will be an SVP member in the porch after every mass this weekend. They will make themselves known to you. Please stop by and give them your details and we will be in touch.

Alternatively you can [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/).
