The B-Attitudes, the group for our younger members of our parish's SVP, spent their latest meeting sorting out and bagging up all of the stamps you donated for the RNIB (Royal National Institute for the Blind). They filled two very large envelopes and these have now been posted to the RNIB, where it will be used to support blind and partially sighted people in our community. We have asked for another collection box for the church porch. Thank you for your continued support of this very worthy organisation.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
