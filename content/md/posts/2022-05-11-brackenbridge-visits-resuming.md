The SVP received some great news this week: Visitors are now welcome again at Brackenbridge Care Home! Before the pandemic, the SVP and B-Attitudes visited Brackenbridge on a weekly basis, building some great relationships with the residents. During the pandemic, we have kept in touch by sending weekly DVDs of mass as well as sending Christmas gifts for all residents and staff. We will resume our visits soon.

There is a little bit of sadness in that only two of the residents we visited remain at the home, the rest having passed away. Covid hit them hard.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
