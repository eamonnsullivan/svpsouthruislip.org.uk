Gifted, the SVP shop, will be opening next weekend, a bit early this month to make way for a cake sale to celebrate the Queens Platinum Jubilee the following weekend. There are a few feasts days in June: The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, St Anthony and Our Lady of Perpetual Help. We will have items to mark these, as well as the usual gifts and cards.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
