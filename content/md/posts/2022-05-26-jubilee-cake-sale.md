Your parish SVP has a few events going on over the coming days to highlight: Gifted, the SVP shop, will be open this weekend after every mass with a selection of cards and gifts. Our bereavement group is gathering on Wednesday, after the 10am Mass, in the church hall. And, next weekend, the B-Attitude Group will host a cake sale to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, raising funds for their initiatives including activities at Brackenbridge House Care Home and a Hillingdon Homeless shelter.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
