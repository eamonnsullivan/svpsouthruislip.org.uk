This weekend, as the country celebrates the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, our young person's group, the B-Attitudes, will be hosting a cake sale. This will take place outside the church after the 5.30pm mass on Saturday and after the 10am and noon masses on Sunday. If we have any left, we'll sell them after the 6pm mass as well.

In addition, the B-Attitudes and SVP will be serving tea and coffee after the masses. We will do this in the garden, weather permitting, or in the hall if the weather does not cooperate!

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
