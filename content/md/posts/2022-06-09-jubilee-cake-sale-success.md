The B-Attitudes would like to thank everyone who supported the Jubilee cake sale -- those who baked, those who helped make the tea, and especially those who purchased the cakes. It was a huge success, with over Â£600 raised. The money will be used to support events at Brackenbridge House, a care home in Ruislip, and Olympic House, a homeless shelter in Hillingdon.

A date for your diary: On Saturday, July 9, we will hold a family quiz night in the church hall. More details to follow in the coming weeks.

As always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
