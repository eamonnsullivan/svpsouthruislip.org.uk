The food bank is the SVP activity that is most visible to the parish, so I thought we would let you know about some of the people who visit:

Deirdre, not her real name, is a lovely lady in her 40s who is unable to work due to chronic health issues. She had visited the food bank a couple of times. On a recent visit, she came asking for food she does not need to cook. Inquiring further, we found that she had been unable to pay her electric or gas bill. The SVP was able to top up her utilities and provide her food. She also met with a benefits adviser at the food bank, who helped sort out her benefits.

A few weeks later Deirdre returned, but not for food. Her benefits were now in place and she came with a card of thanks and a Â£20 donation to help others who attend food bank.

Keep all of the food bank visitors in your prayers and, as always, if you come across anyone who needs help or a visit from an SVP member, please do not hesitate to [contact your SVP team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
