It is time to get your team together for the SVP Family Quiz Night on Saturday, July 9. Each team can have as many as six players, not counting children. The entry fee is £5 per player, and children are free. The doors will open at 6.45pm (after mass) and the quiz will start at 7.30pm.

Please book your table in advance by calling Gillian in the parish office on 020 8845 2186 and paying a £5 deposit. Your entrance fee will include some light refreshments at half time. If you have any questions please chat to Tracy or call the SVP on 07563 775 777.

As always the SVP continues to be here for the parish and our community. If you or anyone you know would like a visit from an SVP member please [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
