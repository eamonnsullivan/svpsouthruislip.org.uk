The SVP shop, Gifted, was due to be open this weekend. Due to Fr Paul's Golden Jubilee celebrations, we have decided to change the opening times to next weekend, after the masses on July 9 and 10.

Also, a reminder that the bereavement group will not meet as usual on the first Wednesday in July, but will meet instead on Wednesday, July 13.

As always the SVP continues to be here for the parish and our community. If you or anyone you know would like a visit from an SVP member [please get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
