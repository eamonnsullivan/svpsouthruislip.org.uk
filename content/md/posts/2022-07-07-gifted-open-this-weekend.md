The SVP shop, Gifted, will be open after all masses this weekend. Please stop by and have a browse among our many gifts and cards.

Also, a reminder that the bereavement group will meet this Wednesday. Bridget and the team will be in the hall after mass with the kettle on.

As always the SVP continues to be here for the parish and our community. If you or anyone you know would like a visit from an SVP member please [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
