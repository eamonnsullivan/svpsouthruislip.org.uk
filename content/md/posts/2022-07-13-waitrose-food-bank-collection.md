The SVP, along with our younger members in the B-Attitudes, will be doing a bucket and food collection at Waitrose in Ruislip this weekend. The bucket collection will raise funds for the SVP, which supports our food bank. Any food collected will be used to stock up the food bank cupboard.

If you are shopping at Waitrose this weekend please stop by our table and have a chat. It will be lovely to see a familiar face!

As always the SVP continues to be here for the parish and our community. If you or anyone you know would like a visit from an SVP member [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
