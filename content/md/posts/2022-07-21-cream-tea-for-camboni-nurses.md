A little while back we met a lovely lady in church, Geraldine, who spoke to us about the work of the [Comboni Missionaries](https://www.comboni.org.uk/) in Sudan. They have set up a [university course](https://combonikhartoum.com/programs/Nursing.html) in Khartoum to train new nurses. Geraldine told us about the good work that its graduates are doing in that country.

The SVP has decided to help raise funds for this cause by hosting a cream tea afternoon on [Saturday, July 30, from 3pm to 5pm](https://svpsouthruislip.org.uk/posts-output/calendar/svp.ics). Come and join us for a cup of tea or coffee, homemade scones with jam and cream and a little something for the children too. We will hold a raffle to raise additional funds. All proceeds will go to the Comboni Nurses.

As always the SVP continues to be here for the parish and our community. If you or anyone you know would like a visit from an SVP member please [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will do our best to help.
