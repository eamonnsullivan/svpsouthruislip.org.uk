The B-Attitudes, the younger members of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society in our parish, are planning a sleep-out on Saturday, Oct. 8, to raise awareness and money for the homeless. They have also set up a [Just Giving](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/b-attitudes?utm_term=69Zmkm5Xz) page. Please consider donating to this worthy cause!
