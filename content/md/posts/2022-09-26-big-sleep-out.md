Autumn is quickly approaching and winter lurks beyond. These seasons can be particularly difficult for our homeless sisters and brothers, but this year our fabulous B-Attitudes Team have decided to do something to help. On Saturday, Oct. 8, a group of these volunteers, safeguarded by a smaller group of adult SVP members, will be having their first 'Big Sleep-Out' in order to raise funds for homeless initiatives that they have in mind.

Fr Paulo has kindly agreed that we can use the church grounds for this Sleep-Out (using just a sheet of cardboard and a sleeping bag!). If you would like to help then please donate to the collection boxes at the Gifted Shop this weekend or online using the [JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/b-attitudes?utm_term=69Zmkm5Xz).

Finally, thank you to all who turned up at our annual SVP mass on Friday, Sept. 23. As ever, please remain aware of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.
