World Homeless Week is Oct. 9 through Oct. 16 this year. To empathise with, and raise funds for, the homeless, a group of our B-Attitude volunteers (i.e. young SVP members) are sleeping out this Saturday evening, Oct. 8, within the church grounds. Your response to this fund-raising appeal has been humbling for all those involved and we wish to express our sincerest gratitude to all of you. Please say a prayer for all the homeless in our world and please use this coming week to raise awareness of this issue among your friends and family. If everyone does a little bit, this helps build God's kingdom here on Earth, as it is in heaven.

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of the need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
