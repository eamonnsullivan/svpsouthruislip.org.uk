Things are busy on a number of fronts for the SVP Team at the moment: Our B-Attitudes are now busy procuring items for the homeless after the amazing 'Big Sleep-Out' fundraiser, the food bank continues to see high numbers of clients, visits to the detention centres in support of the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) are rising, and we are beginning to procure our Christmas stock for the Gifted shop.

This is just a flavour of what we are doing (see the noticeboard in the porch for the full story) and we always need to have new people coming on board. If that is you, then why not say 'Hello', via email, phone or in person, and we will explain how you can join us!

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of the need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
