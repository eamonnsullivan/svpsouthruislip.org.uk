This weekend is a time for remembrance and reflection. And in particular, of course, we remember all those who have lost their lives in conflicts past and present. The SVP team see the impacts of these conflicts in some very real ways. At the food bank, for example, we always meet some clients, our brothers and sisters, who need our help directly as a result of conflict in their home country. Similarly, when we visit our local immigration detention centres, our brothers are there directly because of conflict and strife in their homeland. Only as a result of your ongoing support are we able to continue to help in these ways, and it is a privilege for us to be able to do so. Please accept our sincere and ongoing 'Thank You'.

So, as we remember with sadness all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice let us also remember with hope all the good people like yourselves who are willing to stand up and help. And, as an example of help, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
