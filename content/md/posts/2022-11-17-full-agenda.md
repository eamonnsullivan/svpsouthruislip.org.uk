Last weekend we recommenced our regular weekly visits to Brackenbridge House care home. These visits have been on hold since the pandemic started, and now add to our list of existing activities. These include the food bank, the B-Attitudes, the bereavement support group, our religious items shop, Gifted, visits to our local detention centres near Heathrow, home visits to the lonely, delivery of weekend mass CDs and DVDs to the housebound and supporting our twinned SVP conference in Romania.

It is a pretty full agenda and we always welcome new members!! If that is you, then why not get in touch? It could even be an early New Year's Resolution!!

Finally, as ever, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
