As we enter the beautiful, expectant season of Advent, it is all action in the SVP! A number of work streams are particularly busy at the moment, including the food bank, 'Gifted', the young persons B-Attitudes group, the Bereavement Support Group and the regular visits to Brackenbridge House care home and the refugee detention centres at Heathrow. We couldn't do this work without the support of the parish and the congregation and we say 'Thank You' in advance for any help you are able to give us in the run up to Christmas.

The SVP is about 'Turning Concern into Action.' Our fabulous teams of SVP and B-Attitude volunteers epitomise this. If it appeals to you, then why not consider joining us? As mentioned last week, it's never too early to start your New Year's Resolution!

Finally, as ever, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
