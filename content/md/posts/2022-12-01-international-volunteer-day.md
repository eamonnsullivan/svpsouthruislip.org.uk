Monday is the UN's International Volunteer Day. This is a timely reminder of the great team of young people and adults that we have in the SVP parish family! Not just that, though: We also have a lovely team of people who just like to help us out at the food bank on Saturdays.

Irrespective of the different paths to volunteering, I think all the volunteers would testify to the presence of something 'mysterious' within them that makes them want to put in the effort. This mysterious something is, of course, the power of the Holy Spirit. As a hymn reminds us, '...the power of the Lord is moving in this place..'. Let's all say 'Thank You' to the Lord for being such a tangible presence within our parish and please pray that the Holy Spirit continues to energise our volunteers.

Finally, as ever, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
