We had our final monthly meeting of the year on Monday evening and, as usual, the agenda was pretty full! Thanks to the generosity of the parishioners, and the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit, we are ending the year in good shape. Our 18-strong team, ably supported by the energetic B-Attitudes, are ready to address the challenges that these dark and cold months always bring. Be it the hungry, the lonely, the sick or the imprisoned, we are on standby to help.

Please play your part too, though, and keep an eye on your vulnerable family members, friends and/or neighbours. The first step is to take a step and if we all do something, then that could make all the difference to someone in need.

Our request, as ever, is to please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
