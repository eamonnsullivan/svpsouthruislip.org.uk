Now that we are reaching the end of 2022, it just remains for the SVP Team, and our young persons SVP B-Attitudes Team, to wish all of you a very Holy and Peaceful Christmas and the best of everything for 2023.

The SVP Team was re-established in the parish in 2016, the Year of Mercy, in response to the appeal from Pope Francis for every parish on the planet to perform an act of mercy. Since then, we have only been able to keep going by the power of the Holy Spirit and the tangible support from yourselves. Please accept our heartfelt thanks and please continue to pray for, and support, us as we head in to what looks like choppy waters ahead.

Our final request will sound familiar but is as important as ever: Please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
