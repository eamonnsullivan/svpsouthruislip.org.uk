With the New Year now in motion, the SVP and B-Attitudes teams are already 'back to normal.' Our busiest workstreams at the moment are the food bank, bereavement support, home visits and care home visits. Since we re-formed the SVP in the parish in 2016, we have really only being visiting one care home in our parish, Brackenbridge House. There are others, but we simply do not have enough members to cover them.

Are you able to help? Would you like to make this one of your New Year's resolutions? Perhaps you could be our lead person for one of the other care homes in South Ruislip? If this is something that interests you, then why not think about joining our team? Your commitment can be as large and as small as works for you. It could be the 'something' that you are looking for!! Don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to know more.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
