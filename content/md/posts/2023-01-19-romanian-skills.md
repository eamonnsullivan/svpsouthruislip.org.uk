I wonder if Blessed Frederic Ozanam realised what a global organisation the SVP would become when he founded it in 1833? Today, the SVP has conferences, i.e. local groups, in many countries and the SVP headquarters encourages each conference to twin with at least one conference in another country.

This has some great upsides in that ideas and lessons learnt can be shared, prayers can be offered for each other, friendships can be nurtured and resources can be distributed to where they are most needed. One downside, however, is the language barrier. We are twinned with a conference in Romania but are really struggling to communicate effectively -- even with the help of Google Translate! Can you, or do you know anyone who can, speak or read Romanian? We would truly welcome your help as we strive to better know our Romanian Twin!! We look forward to some help with this request.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
