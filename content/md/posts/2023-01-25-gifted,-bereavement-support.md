The New Year is now moving along and things are getting back to normal for the SVP Team.

* The SVP Gifted shop will be open next weekend, the first Sunday of February, so please have a look at our stock. If there is some religious item that you would like that we have not got, then just mention it. We make regular orders and can try and have it for March.
 * Our Bereavement Support Group is back on the first Wednesday of each month in the hall, after the 10am mass. Please mention this to anyone you think might be just needing a chat -- a cup of tea with some friendly faces might make all the difference!
 * Our young people's B-Attitudes Team held their first meeting of the year on Friday evening and are now busy planning their events calendar for 2023 -- you'll be hearing more!

If any of these activities interest you, or indeed if you'd just like to know about the SVP Team and what we do, then just get in touch!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
