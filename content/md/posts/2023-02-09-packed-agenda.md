We had our February monthly meeting on Monday evening and, as usual, we had a packed agenda that reflected the wide range of workstreams we have in place. Even though it was a cold February night, we have a very strong turn-out in the hall and others joined in online over Zoom.

There is a tremendous energy within the team, and a real longing to do what we can for all those in need. This energy, of course, is powered by the Holy Spirit and, in a very tangible way, it is also powered by yourselves -- our fellow parishioners.

We would like to thank you for all your support, and would like to ask you to pray for all those that we try and help. And in particular, thank you for supporting our Gifted Shop last weekend -- it was almost a sell-out! Don't worry though, more stock has already been ordered!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
