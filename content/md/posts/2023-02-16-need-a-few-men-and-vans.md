One of the blessings of being able to help those in need is that you meet wonderful people, both on the giving side and on the receiving side. Another blessing is that you then have the opportunity of making a real difference, by joining the dots and linking the donations to those in need of them.

One area we struggle with, though, is the practicality of joining the dots -- e.g., arranging transport to pick up a donation of a bed or a table and delivering that to the person in need. If you are able to help, can you please make contact with us? Ideally, we would have a bank of transporters so that the burden can be shared. Please consider this request and respond as you can. You will find it very rewarding.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
