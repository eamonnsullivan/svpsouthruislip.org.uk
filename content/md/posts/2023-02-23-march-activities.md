The noticeable lengthening of the evening is a sure sign that the year is rolling along. The SVP Team is now working on all its fronts and our regular series of events are well in motion.

 * On Friday evening, we held our latest monthly meeting of the B-Attitudes as an outdoor event, by seeking out the homeless in our community and offering them some warm clothing.
 * Our next Bereavement Support Group meeting is in the hall on the first Wednesday of March, this coming Wednesday at 10:30am.
 * Our next SVP Team meeting is on the first Monday of March.
 * Squeezed in between these two events is our Gifted shop, on the weekend of the first Sunday of the month, March 4 and 5.

So: It is all go!! We are doing other things too, so have a look at our website and see if there is something there that you would like to help with. Maybe it could become your Lenten commitment?

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
