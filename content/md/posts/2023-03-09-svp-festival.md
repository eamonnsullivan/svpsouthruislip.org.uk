 The SVP in the Westminster Diocese is holding its annual festival on Saturday, March 25, at [St Aloysius Church](https://parish.rcdow.org.uk/somerstown/) in Euston, starting at 10:30 a.m. Everyone is invited, SVP members as well as non-members. You can book your free ticket [online](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/svp-westminster-diocese-festival-tickets-523531977237) or by contacting the [SVP headquarters](https://www.svp.org.uk/contact-us).

Why not check your calendar and see if this date works for you? It could be the best Saturday you've had in a while! You will hear from the various conferences throughout the diocese and you might learn of all the different types of work being carried it. It might, then, even inspire you to join our conference. We have a growing workload and we can do even more if we have more volunteers. Please do think about this seriously.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
