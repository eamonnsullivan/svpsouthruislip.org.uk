One of the pillars of the SVP is to reach out to the lonely. Many people are very fortunate to be able to visit their mums this weekend, but perhaps even more people are unable to, due to distance or maybe because their mum is no longer with us. So, while some celebrate Mothering Sunday, others feel a terrible sense of loneliness. We try and address this by our home and care home visits and by being available on the phone. We could do with more help, though. We seem to find that the more need we address, the more need we identify.

If helping the lonely, the poor, the sick or the imprisoned strikes a chord within your heart, then why not get in touch? A strong group of volunteers ensures that the work we do is sustainable. So please have a think!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
