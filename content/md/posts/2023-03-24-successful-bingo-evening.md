The SVP team would like to say 'Thank You' to everyone who was able to attend the Bingo evening last Saturday evening. The fact that it was a sell-out gives the team the energy and the confidence to continue to do what we are doing! Please, never underestimate the importance of your supprt to us.

Addressing all the different appeals for need can be daunting sometimes, especially when our inclination, powered by the Holy Spirit, is always to say 'Yes'. So far, we have been able to deliver on each 'Yes' and we know that this has only been possible because of the fabulous parish we have. As Fr Paulo mentioned at the Bingo evening, if you would like to get more involved in the SVP then just reach out to any of us, either by phone, by email or when you see us around and about!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
