Our bereavement support group meets in the hall on the first Wednesday of every month, after the 10am mass. For April, though, the date has moved to Wednesday April 12th. If you know of anyone who usually attends, then can you please let them know.

With the clocks now formally in British Summer Time it is an opportune moment for the SVP Team to say 'Thank You' for your support of the food bank during the winter. Our supplies were very stretched at times, but with local schools, shops, businesses and the congregation all pulling together we managed to make sure that all clients to the food bank went home with at least some items. Supplies still remain at challengingly low levels, however, so we ask you to continue to remember us during your weekly shop.

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
