The SVP Team always receives tremendous support from the parish and the wider community and this is witness that the Holy Spirit really is present today. An upcoming example of this is the weekend of May 12-14. Over that weekend, Waitrose in Ruislip are providing us with space at their front door for a food bank appeal. There will be teams of volunteers there, between 10am and 6pm, with shopping trolleys and money boxes, a table and some leaflets.

Experience from last year showed that the shopping trolleys soon fill up, as customers buy something in the shop and then put it in the trolley on the way out. We therefore need some drivers over the three days who are willing to bring the shopping trolley supplies from Waitrose back to the church hall.

If you have transport, and can spare an hour that weekend, then can you please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/). The more drivers, the less effort for each one!

God Bless.
