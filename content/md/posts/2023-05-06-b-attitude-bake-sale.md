The B-Attitudes is a group of young people who meet once a month to plan and carry out activities to help the South Ruislip SVP and the local community. We do many fundraising events throughout the year and we would like to welcome you to attend a bake sale that we have planned for the 27th and 28th of May. We will be selling cakes before and after 6:00 mass on Saturday and 10:00 and 12:00 mass on Sunday.

All funds that are raised from this event will go to Brackenbridge House Care Home and Mary's Meals.

Don't forget to buy a cake!

God bless.
