As a parish, we are blessed to have such a lovely B-Attitudes Team (i.e. young SVP)! They are full of energy and ideas and are a real backbone to helping us run the food bank every Saturday. They are always planning ahead and their next initiative is a cake sale on the next Bank Holiday weekend, May 27 and 28. They are raising funds on behalf of Mary's Meals. For just Â£20, Mary's Meals can provide a meal to a child every day of the school year through their volunteers in Africa. The cake sale is also raising funds to provide Christmas gifts to the residents of our local care home, Brackenbridge House. If you would like to bake for the cake sale then please just phone our number below or, alternatively, if you could support the cake sale by making it a sell-out then that would be great too!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
