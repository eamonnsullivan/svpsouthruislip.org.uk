Just a reminder of the upcoming cake sale being arranged by our parish B-Attitudes Team (i.e., young SVP)!

Next weekend, they are holding a cake sale after all masses to raise funds on behalf of Mary's Meals and also to provide Christmas gifts to the residents of our local care home, Brackenbridge House. For just Â£20, Mary's Meals can provide a meal to a child in Africa every school day for a whole year. If you would like to bake for the cake sale then please just phone our number below or, alternatively, if you could support the cake sale by making it a sell-out then that would be great too!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
