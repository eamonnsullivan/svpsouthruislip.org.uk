We hope you enjoy the cake sale this weekend, organised by our B-Attitudes (i.e. young SVP) team! Thank you in advance for your support, and the B-Attitudes will be using all the proceeds for Mary's Meals and for Christmas gifts for the residents of our local care home, Brackenbridge House.

Next weekend, our religious items shop, Gifted, will be open after the weekend masses so have a think during the week if there is anything in particular you need from it. If we don't stock it then just let us know and we'll get it for you.

Another date for your calendar is Wednesday 7th June, when the Bereavement Support Group will meet in the hall after 10am mass. Please come along if you just want someone to talk with, and if you fancy a cup of tea!!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
