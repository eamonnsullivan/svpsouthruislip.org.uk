The B-Attitudes would like to say a sincere thank you to all who made last weekend's cake sale such a success! Everything was sold out by the noon mass and the funds raised on behalf of Mary's Meals and Christmas gifts for the residents of Brackenbridge House will be gratefully received.

This weekend, the SVP's Gifted shop is open so please have a look at our stock of religious items and let us know if you need something in particular. Another date for your calendar is Wednesday 7th June, when the Bereavement Support Group will meet in the hall after 10am mass. Please come along if you just want someone to talk with, and if you fancy a cup of tea!!

Finally, as always, please remain 'Aware' of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
