We had our monthly SVP meeting on Monday evening and it was a bumper agenda again! We are busy on a number of fronts but, having grown the team to 20 members now, we are in a good place to be able to share the load. Need is all around us though, so there is always a load to share, if you would like to help us!

Being busy can be good but it also risks us missing the obvious, right in front of us. This is true in all walks of life. Can you please be our eyes and ears and if there is an obvious need that the team are missing, or are just too busy and distracted to notice, then can you please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/) and let us know. More importantly, if you, yourself, are in need of some help, then please reach out to any of the team and you can be assured that we will try our very best to help you.

God Bless.
