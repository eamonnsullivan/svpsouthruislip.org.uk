UK Refugee Week commences tomorrow and encompasses the United Nation's World Refugee Day on Tuesday. Some of our team turn their concern into action by supporting the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) with carrying out social visits to people held in detention at Harmondsworth and Colnbrook. We would encourage you to find some quiet time this week to read up on the issue of refugees in today's world, and to become more informed. Our Lord and King, Jesus, is our role model when it comes to defending, and speaking up for, the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. We can do this more effectively if we inform ourselves of the real issues behind the headlines. Let's not remain silent when we see the weakest of our sisters and brothers being further victimised in our society.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
