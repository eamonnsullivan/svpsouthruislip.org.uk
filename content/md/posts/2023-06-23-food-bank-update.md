The SVP gets involved in many activities. One of the most visible is the SVP food bank. The cost of living crisis is affecting many across society. This is having a major impact of those who need to utilise food banks. Here at St Gregory's, as well as our regular visitors, we are seeing new people visiting the food bank each week. The story is very similar: people just can not make ends meet. We would like to thank you for the support as a parish you give the SVP and the food bank and if you can continue to pop donations into the food bank collection box in the parish porch that would be wonderful and gratefully received. Please bear in mind that with the school holidays on the horizon many families will need to find a little extra as children will be home all day.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help!
