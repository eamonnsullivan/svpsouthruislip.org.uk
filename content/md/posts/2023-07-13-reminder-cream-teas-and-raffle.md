A final reminder that, on next Saturday 22nd July 3-5pm, the SVP team will be holding the annual Cream Teas and Raffle fund raising event. We hope that you can make it and that you can bring some of your friends and family too.

Like a pebble that is dropped in a pond, whose ripples then travel and bring about unforeseen benefits, this event may be the same and, who knows, one or two people may find that they want to join the SVP team! Our workload continues to grow, and we do need more members in order that we can deal with issues and requests in a timely and effective manner. Just chat to any SVP member on the 22nd if you'd like to know more.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
