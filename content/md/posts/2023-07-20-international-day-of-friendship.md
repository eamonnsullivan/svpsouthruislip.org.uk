Did you know that next Sunday, July 30, is the UN International Day of Friendship? The aim is to promote friendship between peoples, countries, cultures, organisations and communities. Some people say that it is much harder today to make friends than it was when they were young. This may, or may not, be true but it is something that we can all influence and change.

If you, or someone you know, is struggling to make friends in the parish, then why not reach out to the SVP Team? You can approach any of us for a chat and you can also attend any of our events. If you have free time you could even join the team, and then you are assured of 19 new friends straightaway! This goes for the under-18s too, who will make lots of great friends in our B-Attitudes Team! Why not contemplate on the International Day of Friendship this year, and see where the Holy Spirit leads.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
