We would like to say a huge 'Thank You' to everyone who braved the weather last Saturday and made it to our Annual Cream Teas Afternoon. We raised Â£240 for the SVP activities and you can rest assured that this will be gratefully received by the needy who live amongst us. There was a lovely buzz from multiple conversations in the hall during the afternoon and it really emphasised that we all need friends to talk with, to joke with, and sometimes to cry with. This Sunday is the UN International Day of Friendship, so why not keep an eye out for someone who might need a friend? And, if you then find that your new friend needs the help of the SVP Team, just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will take it from there. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
