They say that every cloud has a silver lining, and we're sure not short of clouds this summer! If the silver lining has meant that you have had a bumper crop in your allotment, then why not bring your surplus fresh fruit and veg to the food bank? The majority of the food that we distribute is non-perishable, bagged or tinned, so any variation to that in the form of freshly grown local crops would be a great addition to the diets of the families we help. You'll see us setting up the food bank at 10:30 a.m. every Saturday in the hall, so that would be the best time to drop off your donations. Now that we've planted the seed, let's pray that it'll bear fruit!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and if someone requires the help of the SVP Team, then just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will take it from there.

God Bless.
