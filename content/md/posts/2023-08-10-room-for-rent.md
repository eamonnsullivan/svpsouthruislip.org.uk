During the week we received a request from a person looking to rent a single or a double bedroom in South Ruislip. If you, or someone you know, is looking to take in a lodger then can you please get in touch with the SVP Team and we can then provide you contact details.

Secondly, we would like to thank you all for the continual support you give to our Gifted shop! It is lovely to have your support and to know that we are able to help you find those particular items that you were looking for, be it a special crucifix, a statue of a particular saint or even a pocket-sized rosary beads! We open on the weekend of the first Sunday of every month so looking forward to your support again after the masses of Sept. 2-3.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and if someone requires the help of the SVP Team, then just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) and we will take it from there.

God Bless.
