Our Gifted Shop is open before and after all masses this weekend, as usual on the first Sunday of the month.

Each month, we look ahead to the upcoming saint and holy days and try and stock some appropriate items. In September, for example, we have St Theresa of Calcutta (on Sept. 5), birth of Blessed Virgin Mary (Sept. 8), St Pio (Sept. 23), St Vincent de Paul (Sept. 27), and Saints Michael, Gabriel and Raphael (the guardian angels) on Sept. 29. In Gifted, you'll find some lovely items such as rosary beads, candles and magnets associated with some of these saints.

If you are looking for something in particular, though, just mention it to one of our volunteers at the table, and we'll do our best to source it for you.

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly aware of need within our community and just get in touch with us if you think our help is needed - we can be contacted on 07563 775777,  info@svpsouthruislip.org.uk and/or www.svpsouthruislip.org.uk. We will always try our best to help. God Bless.
