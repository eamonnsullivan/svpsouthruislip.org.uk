Next Tuesday is World Homeless Day. In an effort to raise funds to help the homeless in our community, some of our B-Attitudes will sleep out on Saturday night in the church grounds. Safeguarded by some adult members of the SVP, this will be the second year that the B-Attitudes marked World Homeless Day in this way. If you would like to donate, then please keep an eye out for the collection boxes this weekend or you can also use our [JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/the-b-attitudes).

Thank you, also, to those who managed to turn up at our Annual SVP Mass last weekend -- it was lovely to see such a range of SVP, B-Attitudes, parishioners and clients!

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
