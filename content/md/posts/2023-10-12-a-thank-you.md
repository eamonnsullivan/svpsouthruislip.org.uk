Firstly, on behalf of the B-Attitudes, we would like to thank everyone who supported the homeless sleep-out event last Saturday night. We were blessed with some mild and calm weather for the second year in a row! Rest assured that all the funds raised will be used to address the many homeless issues in our parish, borough and city.

Secondly, please be aware that next Tuesday, Oct. 17, is the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Why not read up on this, become informed, and see how you can help. Blessed Frederic Ozanam founded the SVP when he became aware and, with the support of people like you, his efforts continue to address poverty all across the globe.

Maybe you'd like to start by joining our team of volunteers? If so, just get in touch!

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly alert to need within our community and [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
