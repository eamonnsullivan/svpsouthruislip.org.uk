One of our workstreams is labelled 'Prayer Events' and this typically involves arranging the annual SVP retreat for the team in April, as well as arranging the annual SVP 'Festival Mass' in September.

Given the current tragic events in the Holy Land, and on the theme of Prayer, we ask for your personal prayers for all those affected. In particular, please pray for those who visit the food bank who have very direct links with the area. Those clients now, more than ever, need to feel the warmth of our Christian love and it is with confidence that we know that your prayers will generate such a feeling through the Holy Spirit.

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly alert to need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed.

God Bless.
