The sharp-minded amongst you will have realised that our Gifted shop is open this weekend, even though it is not the first Sunday of the month! We have opened one week early so that we can all focus on the Holy Days of Obligation coming up this week and in to next weekend. We are very grateful for the support you continue to give to the Gifted shop. If you are looking for anything in particular, just ask one of us at the table.

If you would like to volunteer to help run the shop then please mention that too! Keeping the shop open for all four weekend masses is a challenge so please come forward if you think it will work for you!

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
