With the evenings now drawing in, it is a timely reminder to all of us to keep an eye on our elderly or housebound neighbours. Loneliness remains a sad part of our society and addressing it is one of the cornerstones of the SVP. Why not check in on someone new this winter. That little bit of contact might make all the difference!

In the run-up to Christmas we will be opening our Gifted shop a bit more often, so please keep an eye out for it next weekend and just let us know if there is anything in particular you'd like us to order for you.

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
