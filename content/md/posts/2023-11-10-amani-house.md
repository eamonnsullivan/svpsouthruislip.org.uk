The SVP Team supports the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) by visiting our brothers being held in the Harmondsworth and Colnbrook detention centres, in our borough. To prevent these brothers of ours becoming homeless when they are released into the community, the JRS have recently set up Amani House. They now need to turn this house into a home, though, and are appealing for all sorts of items. If you are having a clear-out, why not check [what is needed](https://www.jrsuk.net/make-our-new-house-a-home/)! And, if helping the JRS is something you'd like to get involved with, then just get in contact with your SVP Team and we'll explain what we do for them. It is incredibly rewarding.

Finally, as always, please remain sensitively and lovingly aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
