If you browse the [Saint Vincent de Paul headquarters website](https://svp.org.uk/), you'll read the words 'compassion' and 'care.' Putting these words into physical action was at the heart of Blessed Frédéric Ozanam's vision for the society, which he founded in 1833. It is noteworthy that these two words rarely feature in reports from the trouble spots of our world today.

As we now begin preparations to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace, Christ our Lord, let us reclaim and take personal ownership of these two words of peace. Let's introduce them, and associated actions, into our daily vocabulary and interactions with our friends and communities. Then, just let the Holy Spirit do the rest.

To close, as ever, please remain sensitively and lovingly aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
