This weekend marks the end of the Church's year and the beginning of a new one! Is your inner self, your soul, beginning to wonder what new resolution to take up, to mark this new year in the life of the Church? Is your soul nagging you, longing to make contact with its brother and sister souls in the people of the parish around you? Do you sometimes feel an unsettled, burning sensation within you? This may well be your inner self, your soul, the Holy Spirit, communicating with you to say that it longs to put your gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit into action! 'Turning Concern into Action' is the global motto of the SVP, and joining your local SVP Team may be one way of responding to your soul. We are always in need of new members and you will be guaranteed to make some new friends!! Just get in touch if this fits the bill for you!!

To close, as ever, please remain aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
