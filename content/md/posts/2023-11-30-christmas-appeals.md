The run-up to Christmas is always a time full of appeals for the needy. This year it is no different and the SVP appeals are already out there, in the form of our reverse Advent Calendar, for example. Amidst these, it can be easy to forget that the spirit of the needy person might also need help. So, if you can, please pray for our needy, that they may receive inner strength to deal with their issues and then the Holy Spirit will do the rest!

And speaking of appeals; you might remember the B-Attitudes cake sale earlier in the year. Well, with some of the funds raised, they have now assembled some Christmas presents for the residents of our local care home, Brackenbridge House. It is brilliant to see our young people engaging with the elderly in our parish -- another work of the Holy Spirit!!

To close, as ever, please remain aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
