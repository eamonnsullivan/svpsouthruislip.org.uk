Sunday is the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a document translated into more than 500 languages. Before that, in 1833, Blessed Frédéric Ozanam founded the first SVP conference in Paris. Being guided by the Holy Spirit burning within him, he set out to help those suffering from poverty within his neighbourhood. Since then, the SVP has also become universal and the same Holy Spirit guides each conference today, as it did that first one in Paris.

If you would like to join our conference then why not get in touch. Although the UDHR is 75 years old, there is still so much need to address. Have a think and then reach out to us if you'd like to know more.

To close, as ever, please remain aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
