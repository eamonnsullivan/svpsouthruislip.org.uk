Being the final SVP News of 2023, the team would like to wish all of you a very holy and peaceful Christmas and the very best of wishes for the New Year!

It has been another challenging year for the team, during which your support has given us the energy to keep going! You know by now that the strapline of the SVP is 'Turning Concern into Action.' Generating action requires energy though, both physical and mental. So, we thank you for all your material help, but also for all your prayers. Please continue to pray for us, and for those we try and help, as this will give us the energy to journey in to 2024 with hope and joy.

So, as we close 2023, please remain aware of need within our community and [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
