The SVP Team would like to start 2024 by saying a huge thank you for all the support you showed for the Reverse Advent Calendar initiative and for your amazing support of our Gifted shop in the run-up to Christmas! It is really heartening to know that you are there for us!

The new year is shaping up to be another busy one for the SVP as we try to keep our various workstreams moving forward. 'Many hands make light work', so if you'd like to join then just reach out to any member of the team. Check out our website for more details of the actual workstreams, and the ones we need particular help with are volunteering to help run Gifted, visit the lonely at home or in care homes, mentoring the B-Attitudes and volunteering at the food bank.

Even if you can't formally join up now, please remain aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
