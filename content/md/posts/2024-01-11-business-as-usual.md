We had our first monthly meeting of 2024 on Monday evening and, as usual, it was another bumper edition! Our various work streams are now getting back in to 'Business as Usual' mode, so please feel free to reach out and ask the team if you have any queries about or interest in any of the activities.

You might know by now that the motto of the SVP is 'Turning Concern into Action.' This applies to all of us, really, if we remember the second great commandment that Jesus taught us: 'Love your neighbour as yourself'. In this cold spell of weather, why not turn your concern into action and just keep an eye out for any elderly or vulnerable people living near you. Human to Human contact can make all the difference if you are stuck indoors all day long.

So, please do remain aware of need around us and just [get in touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless and stay warm.
