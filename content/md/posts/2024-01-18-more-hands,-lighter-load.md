It is always encouraging to know that this news item is read each week. And it is even more heartening when someone responds!

Last week, we received two lovely enquiries from people who would like to know a bit more about the SVP and are seeking to join the team. The more hands we have, the lighter the load for everyone and the more help we can be to those in need. If you would also like to become a member then why not get in touch? 'Tis never too late to start that New Year's Resolution!!

And to repeat our request from last Sunday: please keep an eye out for the vulnerable in your neighbourhood during this cold and dark period of the year. As Jesus once said, before returning to His Father; we are now His eyes, His ears, His hands on the Earth, so let's use them to 'Turn Concern into Action'.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need within our community and just [get in touch with the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless and stay warm.
