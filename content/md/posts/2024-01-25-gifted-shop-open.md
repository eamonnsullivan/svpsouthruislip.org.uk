The New Year is now ticking along, as all the others have, and so much so that next weekend is the first weekend of February! This means that the SVP's shop, Gifted, will be open before and after each weekend mass. Being open just once a month, and with an early Easter (Easter Sunday is March 31), you'll find that we have stocked up on some Easter items and also on some St Patrick's Day items too. Add to that, our usual selection of prayer cards, Rosary beads, candles, etc., etc., we hope you find what you are looking for.

If there is something in particular that you are seeking, then just ask one of us at the table and we'll do our best to source it for you. Thank you in advance for your ongoing support of this particular SVP work stream.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and just [get in touch with the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed.

God Bless.
