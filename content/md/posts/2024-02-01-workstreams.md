The SVP team, and our various workstreams, are now very much back to 'Business as Usual' mode and you'll see evidence of this in the porch this weekend with our Gifted shop. Monday night, then, sees our second monthly meeting of the year and then on Wednesday in the hall, after the 10am mass, you'll find our Bereavement Support Group running their monthly tea and coffee support/drop-in session. Our other workstreams, such as home, carehome and detention centre visits continue as normal as do the B-Attitudes (Young Persons SVP) and the food bank, of course.

Your support is the lifeblood of all these activities so please be assured of our prayers and thanks. And, if any of these workstreams strike an interest in you then [just make contact with the team](../../pages-output/contact/) and we'll explain more! Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and just get in touch with the SVP if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
