You may recently have read the statistic that more than 50 major elections, involving a total electorate of 2 billion people, are due to take place this year. If this is true, then this is a record for any given year! We, too, will likely face a general election, so why not prepare and inform yourself of the important issues?

A quick browse of the national [SVP website](https://svp.org.uk/) will give you a good flavour of the issues of social justice that we all have a say in. Rather than letting a newspaper headline, or the politician with the loudest voice, govern your opinion, maybe you could use this 'quiet' time to do a bit of background reading and a bit of self-education, which will then place you in a much more informed position when the big day comes!! Have a think!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and just [get in touch with the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
