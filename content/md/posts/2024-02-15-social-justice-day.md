Tuesday is the UN World Day of Social Justice, a topic that has underpinned the mission of the SVP since Blessed Frederic Ozanam founded the very first SVP conference, in Paris, in 1833. Social justice is a very live issue today, just as it was 191 years ago. Jesus once said to Judas that we would always have the poor with us -- not as a *fait accompli*, but as an observation of how we have set up society. It may well be that we have set up society in a faulty way, resulting in the difficult social justice issues that we face.

That is not the end of the story, though. Jesus also left us with the Gifts of the Holy Spirit -- for example, Wisdom, Understanding, Courage, Right Judgement.... Why not consider how you could use these gifts to address social justice issues? And why not consider tuning in to some of the [online talks](https://www.un.org/en/observances/social-justice-day) on social justice on Tuesday!

And, as ever, please remain aware of social justice issues around us and just [get in touch with the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
