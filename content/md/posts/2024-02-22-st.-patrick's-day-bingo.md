The SVP is, again, planning to hold a St Patrick's Day Bingo Night this year, on Saturday, March 16. This event will be raising funds for the parish. Fr Paulo, the parish team and the parish congregation -- i.e., you -- are tremendous supporters of the SVP and so we'd like to now give back as a 'Thank You'. Due to the size of the hall, and the popularity of previous bingo evenings, the event will be ticket-only and you can buy yours after next weekend's masses.

Also, next weekend, the SVP Gifted shop will be open after these masses. This will be the last Gifted before Easter, so please make sure you pay us a visit if you need any Easter gifts or cards for your friends and family.

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of need around us and just [get in touch with the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is required. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
