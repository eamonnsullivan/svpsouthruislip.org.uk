You'll have probably noticed our SVP shop, Gifted, in the porch on the way in to Mass. Given that Easter falls early this year, this will be the last Gifted beforehand, so please make sure you have a look and take the opportunity to purchase some lovely gifts there.

On the way out of Mass, then, you'll have a chance to buy tickets for our St Patrick's Night Bingo on Saturday, March 16. As mentioned last week, this year the SVP are running the bingo in order to raise some funds for the church, as a way of saying 'Thank You' and giving back. The Bingo evening is always great fun so make sure you buy a ticket before they all sell out!

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of need around us and just [get in touch with the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is required. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
