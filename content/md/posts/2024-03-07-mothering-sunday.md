We hope that everyone celebrating Mother's Day this weekend has a lovely day and we'd like to thank everyone who supported us last weekend, when we had both the Gifted Shop open and the St Patrick's Day Bingo tickets on sale after the weekend masses. It is a real energy boost for the SVP Team when we see your support in action and we're looking forward to a lovely 'homely' bingo evening next Saturday!

With the days lengthening, and the weather picking up, why not take a stroll to your elderly or housebound neighbours, who may have had a long winter, and just say 'Hello' to them from the SVP Team. Caring for the lonely is one of the four pillars of the SVP so just [reach out to us](../../pages-output/contact/) if you then think that our help would be useful. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
