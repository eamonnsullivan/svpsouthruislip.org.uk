The SVP Team would like to thank everyone who helped make last Saturday's bingo evening such a lovely event. As a team, we are conscious that we always seem to be asking you for things, so it was a real blessing for us to 'give back' and to be able to arrange the bingo evening while raising funds for the needs of the parish. Thanks to you, it was a complete sell-out and the parish coffers are now better off to the tune of Â£600.00. We hope that those who attended had a joyful and fun evening and the mix of ages was really brilliant to see!

Please God, future members of the SVP, B-Attitudes and Mini-Vinnies are out there!! We wish you all a Holy and Hope-filled Easter and, to close, please remain aware of need around us and just [reach out to us](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
