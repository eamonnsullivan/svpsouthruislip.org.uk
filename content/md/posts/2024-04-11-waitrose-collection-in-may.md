We hope you all had a holy and peaceful Easter and 'Thank You' to everyone who donated to the food bank over the period. Rest assured that the Easter eggs were gratefully received by the families. Thank You, also, to everyone who purchased items from our Gifted shop last weekend. It is always great to see your support for this initiative!

We had our monthly meeting on Monday evening and it is all systems go on a number of fronts. We had a strong turnout, despite the torrential rain, and we welcomed a new member to the team!

An upcoming event for us is a food bank collection at Ruislip's Waitrose over the weekend of May 24, 25 and 26th. We will need help with transporting the collection from Waitrose back to the church hall and unloading into the storeroom. If you are free that weekend then please get in touch. Every pick-up and drop-off will help during what is always a busy event!

To close, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out to us](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
