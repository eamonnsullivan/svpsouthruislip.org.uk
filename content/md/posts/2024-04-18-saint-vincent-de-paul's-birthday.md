Birthdays come around quicker and quicker, it seems, and on Wednesday we are blessed to be able to remember that of St Vincent de Paul again! He was born in Gascony in 1581 and went on to spend much of his life in Paris, where he set about addressing the issues of poverty and hunger in very practical ways. As a result, he is known as the patron saint of charity and this inspired Blessed Frederic Ozanam to name his new group of charity workers 'The Saint Vincent de Paul Society' in 1833!

So, the SVP Team, and all SVP Teams, have two amazing role models to look towards when dealing with the very same issues of poverty and hunger today. As in 1581 and 1833, these issues continue to challenge, and as a corollary, provide opportunity: an opportunity to allow the Holy Spirit work through us and show the Love of God to others.

As always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
