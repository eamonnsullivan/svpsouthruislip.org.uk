We hope you like our selection of gifts in Gifted this weekend! As always, if there is anything in particular that you are looking for then just mention it to us and we'll see if we can get it for you. We usually look ahead to the feast days and saint's days that are coming up and then we try and find some relevant items for those special days in the life of the Church. If you see a gap, though, then please let us know and we'll try and plug it! This time of year, of course, we also have some lovely First Holy Communion and Confirmation gifts. So, happy shopping and thanks again for all your support.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out to us](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
