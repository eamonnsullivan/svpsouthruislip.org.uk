Next Thursday marks the International Day of Living Together in Peace. The SVP's social justice mission of 'Turning Concern into Action' is just one example of how the everyday people of this world can bring a little peace to those around us. Our four pillars of helping the lonely, the poor, the sick and the imprisoned aim to bring peace to those who find themselves suffering from these issues. The SVP's help is there for anyone in need, irrespective of race, colour or creed. Blessed Frederic Ozanam set these founding principles for the SVP 191 years ago, long before the International Day of Living Together in Peace was established! If you'd like to turn your concern into action then why not contact us!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
