We'd like to thank everyone who continues to donate food to the food bank via our donation box in the porch. You can rest assured that your donations are very gratefully received by the many clients we still see visiting us each Saturday. You typically help 85 - 95 families each week by your donations and this number could easily equal about 350 of our brothers and sisters suffering from hunger through poverty.

Next weekend, May 24-26, we are doing a donations drive at Waitrose in Ruislip, who do some fantastic community outreach throughout the year. If you see us at the main shop entrance in the carpark on those days, then why not stop and say hello? We'd love to see some familiar faces!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
