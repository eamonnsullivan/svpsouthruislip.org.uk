Pope Francis, in his writings, asks us to use our faith to create 'a culture of encounter.' Given that we have a general election soon, both the SVP and CAFOD have labelled this year, ['A Year of Encounter'](https://svp.org.uk/encounter). We are asked to inform ourselves of the issues of social justice within our society, so that we can ask our politicians to prioritise these. We are asked to encounter our politicians -- be it at town hall hustings or just researching their standpoints online -- so that we can arrive prepared at the polling booth on July 4. We all have a duty to cast our vote to promote the common good. So why not use these six weeks to do your research?

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
