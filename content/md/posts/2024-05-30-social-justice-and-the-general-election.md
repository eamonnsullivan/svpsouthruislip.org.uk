Well, a week certainly is a long time in politics! With the general election now announced, it means the time is short to encounter the key issues of social justice, and the candidates on offer to lead us through them. As mentioned last week, both the SVP and CAFOD have labelled this year ['A Year of Encounter'](https://svp.org.uk/encounter). Please try and find time to visit this link and inform yourselves ahead of election day on July 4. We all have a duty to cast our vote to promote the common good and the election is when we are obliged to exercise this duty.

And, having researched those key issues of social justice, maybe the Holy Spirit will spark something within you that will make you want to do something 'hands-on'. If you wish to act on the SVP's strapline, 'Turning Concern into Action,' then just get in [touch with us](../../pages-output/contact/)!

God Bless.
