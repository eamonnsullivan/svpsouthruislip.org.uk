Thank you to everyone who supported our shop, Gifted, last weekend. Please remember that if there is anything in particular that you need, just please ask us. We'll do our best to find it for you.

On a similar note, thank you to everyone who continues to donate to the SVP in the parish -- be it by prayer, the coin box or the food bank donations box in the porch. Your support is crucial to us as we continue our best efforts to address need in the various forms that it presents itself. The task can be challenging, but it is always rewarding!

If you have spare time, and you are up for the challenge too, then why not [get in touch](../../pages-output/contact/) -- you'll never look back!!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and just reach out if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
