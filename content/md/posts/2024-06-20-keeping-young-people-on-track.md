Keeping young people on the right track can be a challenge these days! With summer holidays now not too far away, maybe you have some young people looking for things to do?

One long-term solution could be the SVP groups specifically aimed at nurturing young people: the Mini-Vinnies for primary school students and the B-Attitudes for secondary school students. Mini-Vinnie groups tend to be hosted by schools (St Swithun Wells has a group, for example), while the parish actually hosts a B-Attitudes group. These are, if you like, the foundations of the future adult SVP Team!

So, now that you are aware of these groups, why not suggest them to your youngsters! And, then, let the Holy Spirit do the rest!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
