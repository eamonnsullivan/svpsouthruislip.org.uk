The beginning of each month is usually busy for the SVP as we have our monthly meeting on the first Monday, the bereavement support group on the first Wednesday (10:30 a.m. in the hall) and then the Gifted shop on the first Sunday (and preceding Saturday night). Thank you in advance for your support and prayers with these activities and please remember that our help is available all through the month!

When you are close to the coalface it is sometimes hard to see the bigger picture so, if you spot a gap in the care and concern that we are putting into action then please feel free to let us know and we'll see if we can fill it. And, we are always on the lookout for new members to plug such gaps - hint, hint ðŸ™‚!!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
