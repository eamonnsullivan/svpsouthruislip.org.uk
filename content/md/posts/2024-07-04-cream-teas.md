We had our monthly meeting on Monday evening and, as always, it was a packed agenda! It started with us welcoming a new member to the team, our 20th, and this really consolidates our strength in depth. We certainly have plenty of space for more new members, who then bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the wider team, so please come forward if you'd like to come onboard.

An event and date for your calendar is the SVP Cream Teas Afternoon, on Saturday, July 27, from 3 p.m. until 5 p.m.. This is the first fund raising event of the year for the SVP so we're hoping for a good turnout, as well as some sunshine!! Please bring family, friends and neighbours and you never know - you might inspire some new SVP members too!!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
