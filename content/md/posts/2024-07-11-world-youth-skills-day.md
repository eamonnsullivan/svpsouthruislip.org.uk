A few Sundays back we mentioned the B-Attitudes team (i.e., the young person's SVP) are always looking for new members. As a pure co-incidence, you might like to know that Monday is the UN's World Youth Skills Day, with the theme for 2024 being "Youth Skills for Peace and Development". It is the youth of today who will be solving the problems of an ever more complicated world in the future and, in order to address those problems, the UN has obviously concluded that today's youth need to be nurtured in the skills of peace and development.

This nurturing is exactly what the B-Attitudes is all about, making our young people aware of social justice, acts of love and compassion and the real presence of the Holy Spirit helping us to do our best. If you, or someone you know, would like to join the B-Attitudes, then just get in touch!!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
