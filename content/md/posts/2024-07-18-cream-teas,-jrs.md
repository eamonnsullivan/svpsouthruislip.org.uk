Just a reminder that we are holding our annual SVP Cream Teas next Saturday afternoon from 3pm to 5pm. If the weather co-operates we will set up some tables outside so, please God, it will be a lovely event. This is the first SVP fundraiser of 2024 so we'd really appreciate your support and don't be shy about bringing your family and friends also!

On a more profound note, you may have followed the news about the [shocking conditions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx82wq77229o) at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre found by HM Inspector of Prisons. If you would like to provide some hope and a friendly face to those being detained then why not get in touch with us? We support the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) in exactly that. I'm sure if roles were reversed we would absolutely welcome a friendly voice. Have a think and rest assured that helping the JRS is a humbling and blessed opportunity.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
