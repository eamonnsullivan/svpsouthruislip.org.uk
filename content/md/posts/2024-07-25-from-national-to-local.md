Have you ever browsed the national [SVP website](https://www.svp.org.uk)? If you can, why not pay it a visit sometime and you'll get a lovely flavour of all the different areas that the SVP covers.
Whether it be advocating for Social Justice at government level, helping the most vulnerable at community level or linking with our brothers and sisters in need overseas you will see the real evidence of the Holy Spirit turning concern into action.

At our team (known as an SVP conference) level, we try to mirror these examples through our workstreams such as the food bank, the bereavement support group, home, carehome and detention centre visits and such like. If you would like to help, or if you have any ideas for us, then why not get in touch! We'd love to hear from you.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
