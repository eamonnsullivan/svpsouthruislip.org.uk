'Tis funny how Life is now categorised into pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. Habits and daily routines have certainly changed. Our food bank is just one small example: Pre-pandemic we would normally have seen at each session, say, 10 clients and would have had plenty of time to chat and get to know them. Our new normal is now between 80 and 90 clients on a typical Saturday!

This brings challenges and exposes weaknesses. Probably our biggest weakness at the moment is our lack of language skills. Are you able to communicate in Arabic, Farsi, Polish, Ukrainian or Romanian? And would you like to volunteer at our food bank? You do not need to commit to every Saturday, but if you could help out, even a little, then that would be a huge help to our clients, and to us! Why not have a think and then just reach out to us! We'd love to hear from you.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
