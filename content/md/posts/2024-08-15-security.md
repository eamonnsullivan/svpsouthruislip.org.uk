It should be no surprise that good always triumphs over adversity, but it is easy to forget this when we are surrounded by so much negative news, such as the recent civil unrest.

One example of good is that this civil unrest made us sit up and re-evaluate our various workstreams, particularly our food bank. Even though we have been operating it since 2016, we have always tweaked it to suit prevailing conditions. We did this most dramatically in March 2020 when the Covid-19 lockdowns first started, when we ran all operations outdoors and with a much-reduced team of volunteers serving an increasing number of clients.

The recent civil unrest, then, made us introduce some more tweaks such that the hall is more secure, our awareness of risk is healthily heightened and our humanity-based welcome to our clients is to the fore. Thanks to God, working through the Holy Spirit, our food bank session was very calm and inspiring and we sincerely ask for your prayers that this continues.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
