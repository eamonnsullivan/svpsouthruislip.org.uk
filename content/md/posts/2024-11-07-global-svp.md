The SVP Team is as busy as ever, but with your support, we know we can maintain the pace! And knowing that the work is ultimately guided by the Holy Spirit, and is done in unison with our global Vincentian family, is a real energiser too.

To get an idea of the reach of the global SVP why not visit [the global web site](https://www.ssvpglobal.org/en/). You'll quickly get an appreciation of the legacy that Blessed Frederic Ozanam left us. As a 20-year-old student in the Sorbonne he must really have had a sense of needing to use his gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit for the betterment of those around him. His legacy is now at work in 155 countries, through 800,000 members. Those are impressive figures!

Please enjoy exploring the website and if you'd like to know more about your local team then just get in touch. Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and [just reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
