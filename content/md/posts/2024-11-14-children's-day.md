Wednesday is the UN's World Children's Day. Please research what this means for you and then raise awareness of the issues among your friendship group. When social justice is lacking, the first victims are usually those already defenceless, such as those suffering from poverty, illness and loneliness. A child in the midst of these issues must be even more vulnerable. The SVP's mission is to seek out the vulnerable and to bring practical aid to them, with compassion.

The SVP strapline is 'Turning concern into action' so, on Wednesday, why not challenge yourself to identify if you, or we, can do more to help any children in need in our neighbourhood. Then see if you, or we, can action our concern. With the power of the Holy Spirit anything really is possible!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of other needs around us too and just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
