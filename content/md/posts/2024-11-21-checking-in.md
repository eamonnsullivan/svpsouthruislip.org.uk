With the noticeable shortening of the days, and the recent cold snap in the weather, the approach of winter is becoming more tangible! These changes act as a good reminder to all of us to keep an eye on our vulnerable neighbours. Just a simple knock on the door, or tap on the window, can make all the difference to a person living with loneliness. Don't underestimate the value of these little acts! Just let yourself become an instrument of the Holy Spirit and then your little acts will work magic by giving a sense of hope and love to a person feeling cut off during the winter.

Loneliness is a national, actually a universal, problem so if you'd like to get more involved re addressing it then just contact the SVP team or even check out https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/ and let the Holy Spirit guide you!! Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and just reach out if our help is needed - we can be contacted on 07563 775777,  info@svpsouthruislip.org.uk and/or www.svpsouthruislip.org.uk. We will always try our best to help. God Bless.
