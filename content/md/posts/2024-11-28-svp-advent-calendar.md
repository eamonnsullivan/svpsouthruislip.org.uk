The SVP would like to say a huge thank you to all who picked up an SVP food bank Advent calendar last weekend. It was very encouraging to see that none were left after the 6pm mass on Sunday. If you did miss out on one, and you wish to respond to the appeal, then please note that an advent calendar is on display on our noticeboard in the church porch. Simply take a photo of it and then you'll have a list of what is needed whenever you go shopping. Remember, too, that we also have a list of the items we generally need [on our website](https://svpsouthruislip.org.uk/pages-output/foodbank/#donations). Have a browse of it sometime and you might even find some other useful information.

A reminder, too, of what Fr Paulo clarified: The numbers on the calendar represent the dates, and not the number of items. On Dec. 19, we do not expect you to donate 19 bags of rice!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of other needs around us too and just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
