Christmas time is always a very humbling time for the SVP Team. The generosity of the parish continues to be an inspiration to us. The SVP team is in a very privileged position to pass on this generosity to those in need. The team is rewarded umpteen times over by the beautiful, and sincere, words of thanks from the recipients, as well as by their hopeful and cheerful smiles! These smiles need to be reflected back on to you, the parish, though, as you are the source!

Please rest assured that all you do for those in need is gratefully received and if you ever want to get closer to the action then just get in touch with any SVP member about joining us. You will find it incredibly fulfilling and rewarding.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of other needs around us too and just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
