The SVP team would like to wish all of you a very holy and peaceful Christmas and the very best of wishes for 2025! Please accept our sincere thanks for supporting and sustaining us throughout 2024. It has been another busy year on all fronts for us, as need continues to be part of the fabric of our society.

During this season of Christmas, and as we head into another 12 months, maybe it wouldn't go amiss to pray to the Holy Spirit that the world acts with gentleness -- the same gentleness that Mary, our Mother, must have exercised when caring for her newborn baby Jesus.

Finally, as always, please remain aware of other needs around us too and just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
