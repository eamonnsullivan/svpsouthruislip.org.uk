Addressing loneliness is one of the four pillars of the SVP, along with caring for the sick, helping the poor and visiting the imprisoned. Given the cold spell of weather, and the darker evenings, we ask that all who can to please keep an eye out for your vulnerable neighbours.

Spending 24 hours a day indoors must be very lonely and watching people passing too and fro outside your window must be very isolating. It doesn't take much time to just check up on your neighbour, even if it is just a quick phone call or a tap on the window. The smallest little act of human love can make a huge difference so please do consider if this appeal applies to you.

And then, if you think that the help of the wider SVP Team is required, just please [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to us.

God Bless.
