A 'Thank You' can come in many shapes and forms! A client to the food bank recently said thank you in the form of a poem, and it is really to all of you who support the SVP, day in and day out. We hope you like it:


> On a frosty cold winter's morning,<br/>
> the darkness broken by warm festive lights above,<br/>
> children singing carols, reminding of our Saviour's love.<br/>
> People rushing, tapping away on their phones,<br/>
> all kinds people but most seem like clones.<br/>
> Then someone stops to greet a neighbour or friend,<br/>
> a warm smile, catch up or lending a hand.<br/>
> A smile that carries through their day,<br/>
> a little kindness goes a long way.<br/>
> It reminds me that, even if there are ever-dark clouds above,<br/>
> to be thankful the world is full of joy, beauty and love.<br/>
> So, I look forward to a new year we start,<br/>
> may God keep safe all those in my heart. <span style="color:red">‚ù§</span><br/>


Finally, as ever, if you or someone you know needs the help of the SVP team, just please [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to us. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
