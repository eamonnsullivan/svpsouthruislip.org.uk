In a recent SVP News item we referred to the four pillars of the SVP. As a reminder, these pillars are helping the lonely, the sick, the poor and the imprisoned.Addressing the first pillar, loneliness, is a real concern for many good hearted people, including those in the World Health Organisation (WHO) who have declared it to be a global public health concern.

The [website](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org) is also a great source of information on an issue that appears to affect many people today, especially young people.

Addressing loneliness has been a pillar of the SVP since its foundation in 1833, so if you need help with this, please just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to us. We'll always do our best to help.

God Bless.
