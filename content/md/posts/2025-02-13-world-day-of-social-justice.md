Next Thursday is the World Day of Social Justice. This means that it is a big day for organisations, such as the SVP, which advocates on behalf of those suffering the tragic effects of social injustice.

There are too many examples in the daily news and no one person can solve this. But, if we all take a baby step in our local community, then all those baby steps will absolutely add up to change. Jesus taught us this message 2,000 years ago and we are still seeing this truth play out in front of our eyes.

One such baby step might be you joining your local SVP Team! We always need new members as our workload continues to expand. Just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to any of the members if you'd like to know more.

God Bless.
