Our foodbank remains our busiest workstream and it seems to continue to be as busy as ever. We are sustained by your tremendous support and prayers and by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Our volunteering team, each Saturday, typically consists of 15 or so adults and 8 or 9 young people, representing a lovely mix from our community! The range of backgrounds, talents and skills is amazing, but we always do struggle with the variety of languages spoken by our clients. Are you able to add this little nugget to our blend? Are you able to converse in, say, Arabic, Polish, Romanian, Farsi, Hindi? If so, why not contact us and see if you can make a difference! We get by using Google Translate and hand signals, etc., but it would mean so much to our clients if they could speak with someone who understands their mother tongue!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around us and just [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think the SVP can help.

God Bless.
