Exercising your awareness sensors is just as important as exercising your mind and limbs! Are you aware of the fundamental Christian principle of social justice? Have you ever delved deeper in to the meaning of those two words? It is very easy to come up with examples of social injustice and to then come up with reasons for why society is so. Coming up with, and applying, solutions is more difficult though.

Blessed Frederic Ozanam, the founder of the SVP, started with just some small steps in his own community. He then let the Holy Spirit do the rest. The social justice that has flowed from his first steps leaves one in a state of wonder and awe.

If you'd like to be part of the ongoing story of the SVP, no matter what age you are (Mini-Vinnies for Primary School age, B-Attitudes for Secondary School age, SVP for adults), then just reach out to us and we'll tell you all about it!! And, when exercising your awareness, please [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think the SVP can help with a need that you have spotted. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
