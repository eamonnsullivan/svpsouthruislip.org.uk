It was lovely to see a packed hall last Saturday evening for the St Patrick's Day bingo event in aid of the SVP! As a result of your fabulous support, we raised Â£650 for the various workstreams of our conference.

The SVP team would like to say a huge 'Thank You' to everyone. And not just for the financial support, but for your joy and kind words also! When you are at the coalface, trying to solve problems, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. All of you provide us with the energy and the resources to keep going. Rest assured that your support is gratefully received and we pray to the Holy Spirit to guide us in the best use of those funds.

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of other needs around us too and just [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think the SVP can help. We will always try our best to help.

God Bless.
