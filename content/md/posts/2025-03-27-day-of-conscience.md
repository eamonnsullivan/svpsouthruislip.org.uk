Something moved within Blessed Frederic Ozanam when he first became aware of the poverty so close to the Sorbonne University, where he was a student. The Holy Spirit sparking his conscience into action on behalf of God our Father. Blessed Frederic listened to his conscience, and in response, he went on to found the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the 'SVP'!

Next Saturday is the UN's International Day of Conscience, a day aimed at getting everyone to act in accordance with our conscience and to show love and compassion to those around us. Our conscience knows that there is, actually, right and wrong, kindness and selfishness, inclusion and exclusion. Like Blessed Frederic, why not listen to your conscience and then make the right decision each time you are faced with these options.

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of the need around us and do not hesitate to just [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think our help is needed. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
