The SVP team have our monthly meeting on Monday evening and it promises to be another full agenda! We continue to receive amazing support from you and the wider community and examples of this are local schools, shops and other businesses who regularly replenish our food bank supplies by using some lovely initiatives.

We visited one such primary school last week to say 'Thank You' and the level of intelligent and compassionate questions that the Year 5 students had about our work was inspiring. The power of the Holy Spirit is clearly at work amongst us and we are really blessed to know that.

If the Holy Spirit is stirring something in you, and if you think that helping the needy might be the response being sought, then why not consider joining the team? We always need new members such that the work of the SVP remains sustainable. If you want to 'Turn Concern into Action' then why not get in touch!

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of need around us and just [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think the SVP can help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
