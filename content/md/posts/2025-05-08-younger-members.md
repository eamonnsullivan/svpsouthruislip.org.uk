It was lovely to see the buzz of activity around our fund-raising shop, Gifted, last weekend. This has become a regular source of income for the SVP Team since we started this initiative and your support is always gratefully received.

Our parish is blessed to have an SVP Team as well as a B-Attitudes Team (i.e., SVP for secondary school age volunteers). Did you know, though, that we also have a Mini-Vinnies Team at St Swithun Wells? An SVP grown-up recently attended the Mini-Vinnies Summer Term 1 progress meeting. They comprise of 10 energetic students from Years 4, 5 and 6 and do some lovely work throughout the year to address issues of social justice.

The grown-ups look forward to working with both the B-Attitudes and the Mini-Vinnies in the coming years, such that the parish will always be a beacon of hope for those struggling with the day-to-day challenges of life.

If you are aware of anyone facing such struggles at the moment then please [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to us for help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
