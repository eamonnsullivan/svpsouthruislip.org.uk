As we head into June, the SVP has a few things going on. This weekend our shop, Gifted, will be open. Please stop by and browse our many religious gifts and cards for all occasions. The bereavement care group will meet on Wednesday in the church hall at 10.30. Please pop in for a cuppa and a chat.

As always please keep on eye on each other and if you or someone you know would like to have a chat with the SVP please do not hesitate to [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/). We will always try our best to help.
