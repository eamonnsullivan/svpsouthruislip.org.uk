The SVP at St Gregory's had its monthly meeting this week. We discussed our various activities, including the bereavement care group, the
B-Attitudes, the SVP shop (Gifted), the food bank, visiting those in care homes and visiting people at home.

If you think there is something here you would like to get involved in, please chat to one of our SVP members or contact us.

As always, please keep on eye on each other. If you or someone you know would like to have a chat with the SVP, please do not hesitate to [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/). We will always try our best to help.
