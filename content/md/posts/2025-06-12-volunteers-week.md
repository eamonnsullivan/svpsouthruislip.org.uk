Last week (June 2-8) was the UK's annual Volunteer Week and it was also Pentecost Sunday, of course. Volunteering to do works for the good of your local, or global, community, is merely a manifestation of the Holy Spirit that humankind first received on the very first Pentecost Sunday. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are what are at work when volunteers are at work!

Does something deep inside you sometimes move you to want to help others? And perhaps you're not sure how best to respond? This may well be the Holy Spirit prompting your soul in to action. The SVP has a range of opportunities; the food bank, bereavement support group, visiting the lonely at home, in care homes or in refugee detention centres, helping the SVP shop that we named 'Gifted', mentoring the next generation of young volunteers, etc. If any of these sound interesting and if you think they might help you respond to that inner prompting, then why not get in touch with us? We are always looking for new members.

Finally, as always, please keep an eye out for need around you and just [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
