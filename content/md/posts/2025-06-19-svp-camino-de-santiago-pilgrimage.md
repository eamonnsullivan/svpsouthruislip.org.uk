Our local SVP group is known as a 'conference' and it is part of the national [SVP England and Wales](https://www.svp.org.uk), which itself is part of the [International Confederation of the SVP](https://www.ssvpglobal.org). The SVP England and Wales CEO is Kate Nightingale, to whom our conference ultimately reports, and the President General of the international SVP is Juan Manuel Buergo Gomez.

These two websites have a wealth of information on the work being done by the many members of the SVP throughout the world. They have all the latest news of upcoming events too. Knowing that our parish has many keen walkers, you might like to check out the [SVP Camino de Santiago Pilgrimage 2026](https://svp.org.uk/case-studies/join-svp-camino-de-santiago-pilgrimage-2026), being organised by the national team. And while you're browsing that, you might also find other items of interest, such as the latest national SVP Report on the issue of 'In-Work Poverty.' We all have a duty to make ourselves aware of such issues, which arise from how we have chosen to run our society. It is an excellent read.

Finally, as always, please keep an eye out for need around you and just [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
