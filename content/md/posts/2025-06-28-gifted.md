As we enter July, this is just a reminder that our regular monthly SVP activities are poised to click in to action!!

On Wednesday morning, after the 10am Mass in the hall, we will have our Bereavement Support Group available to offer you a cuppa and a biscuit and a listening ear. Then, after the weekend masses, next Saturday evening and Sunday, we will be running our SVP shop, called 'Gifted.' If you would like to buy any religious items for you or your family and friends, Gifted has a lovely selection of candles, prayer cards, rosary beads and the like. Even if you don't want to buy anything then just pop by the counter anyway for a chat! It is always lovely to see the activity and chatter that Gifted generates!!

Finally, as always, please keep an eye out for need around you and just [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
