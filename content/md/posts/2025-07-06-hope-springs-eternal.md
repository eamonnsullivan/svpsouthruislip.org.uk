'Hope Springs Eternal' is a poem, and phrase, that many will remember from schoolday studies of the works of Alexander Pope. Hope is not to be underestimated and, as such, the UN has declared July 12 as the International Day of Hope.

Hope is part of the DNA of the SVP. It is that special ripple that emanates, almost invisibly, from every little act of kindness. Once that ripple has started, no one can be sure where it will end and what lovely effects it may cause along the way. We see this every Saturday in food bank, for example. And we see it, very much so, at the detention centre. I guess you could call it an unintended consequence of your good deed. Never underestimate the effect it can have on the person on the receiving end.

Why not consider an act of kindness on July 12? A 'Hello' to a stranger, an unplanned check-up on your elderly neighbour, friendly banter with the check-out assistant in the shop -- all these little simple acts of kindness can generate lovely, unintended, consequences!

And, finally, please keep an eye out for need around you and just [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll also do our part in offering Hope.

God Bless.
