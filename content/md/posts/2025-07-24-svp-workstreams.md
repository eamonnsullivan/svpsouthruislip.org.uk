Your SVP team reflects the [mission of the global SVP family](https://svp.org.uk/our-work) in its various workstreams. Poverty is addressed through the food bank, for example, and tackling illness and loneliness is the goal of our home and care home visits, as well as the Bereavement Support Group. Visiting the imprisoned is addressed by detention centre visits. This work is powered by the Holy Spirit, acting through the team members and also acting through the parishioners who support us in such prayerful and material ways.

If one of these activities nudges something within you, then why not consider joining up? New members are always welcome and you'll be joining a wonderful group!

Finally, please keep an eye out for needs around you and [just contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll also do our part in offering Hope.

God Bless.
