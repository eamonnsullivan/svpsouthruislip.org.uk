You'll have seen our shop, known as 'Gifted,' on the way into Mass this weekend. We thank you for the lovely support that you always show for it on the first weekend of each month. Have a look at the items on offer and if ever you need something that is not on the table, just mention it and we'll try to get it in stock.

A reminder that our other monthly activity, the Bereavement Support Group, will not be meeting on Wednesday as the hall is undergoing refurbishment. This group will be back in action again, please God, on the first Wednesday of September, 1030am to noon, in the hall. If you ever need to speak to someone sooner, just contact us as below.

Finally, please keep an eye out for those in need around you and [just contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll also do our best to help.

God Bless.
