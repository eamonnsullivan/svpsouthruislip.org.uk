We would like to say thank you to all of you for the lovely support you showed for our shop, known as 'Gifted', last weekend.

As mentioned in previous SVP News items, it is really homely to hear all the chatter, and especially the voices of the young children, as our various gifts are checked out and assessed!! We're sure you appreciate the range of statues, rosary beads, keyrings, cards etc etc that we have on offer but never be shy to ask us to order something for you if you cannot see it on display.

Finally, please keep an eye out for those in need around you and [just contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we may be able to help. We'll also do our best to help.

God Bless.
