World Homelessness Day is tomorrow (Oct. 10). To mark this day, our fabulous B-Attitudes Team are sleeping out in the church grounds this Saturday evening, safeguarded by some of the members of the adult SVP Team. They have been doing this for a numbers of years now and it always proves to be a really empathetic experience for everyone involved. Please pray for them and for all our homeless sisters and brothers.

On Saturday, Oct. 18, we have the SVP Bingo evening. This is always a popular and fun-filled event! Tickets are on sale after all masses this weekend.

Finally, as always, please keep an eye out for need around you and [just contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we can help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
