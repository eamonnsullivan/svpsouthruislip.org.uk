The SVP Team would like to thank everyone who has supported the bingo evening this weekend and, if you are reading this on Saturday evening, we wish you the best of luck with your numbers!

Also, we would like to thank you for your prayers for our B-Attitudes team who had a sleepout last Saturday evening in empathy for those who have no other choice but to sleep out. Please pray for the homeless in our parish and community. Rest assured that, as a result of your support for our fund raising events, your SVP team are in a good position to help them with essential winter needs such as warm clothing, sleeping bags and food.

Finally, as always, please keep an eye out for need around you and just [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think we can help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
