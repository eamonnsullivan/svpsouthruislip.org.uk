Home visits were traditionally a cornerstone of the SVP mission. Members would call in to see their elderly neighbours at home, and visit them in hospital when the need arose. Teams that were located near prisons would arrange to visit people held there. In more modern times, then, visits to care homes became part of an SVP team's work and, more recently again, visits to institutions such as our local refugee detention

With the clock "falling back" this weekend, it is a good time to remember this basic service of the SVP. Loneliness is a terrible illness in every community. Please keep an eye on your elderly and/or vulnerable neighbours this autumn.

If you are aware of someone suffering from loneliness, and you are unable to find time to spend with them, then please [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to the SVP. We're at the end of the phone, and at the end of the email address, and we'll always do our best to help.

God Bless.
