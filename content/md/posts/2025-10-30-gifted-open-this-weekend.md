Our fund-raising shop, which we call 'Gifted', is open for business this weekend, before and after each mass. Please take time to browse or to just say hello! It is always lovely to hear the buzz around the counter. Remember to let us know if you are looking for something in particular that is not on display. We'll make every effort to source it for you.

And, if volunteering to run Gifted or, indeed, volunteering with the SVP in general is something that interests you then just speak to any one of us or [contact us via phone or email](../../pages-output/contact/). New members are always welcome! The more hands on deck, the more we can help those in need. We wold love to hear from you!

God Bless.
