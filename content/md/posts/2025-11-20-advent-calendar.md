This wintry cold snap is a good reminder, if we needed one, that Christmas is on the way! Christmas is a season of giving. To that end, the SVP team have produced a 'giving'  -- sometimes known as a 'reverse' -- advent calendar, to help replenish the stocks in our food bank. Each day of December has a different item allocated to it, which means that each donation will have a lovely collection of non-perishables by the time we reach Christmas.

If you would like to participate, you will find copies of the advent calendar at the back of church this weekend, and other weekends as long as copies last! To save on paper you could, perhaps, [download a copy](../../pages-output/foodbank/#advent) or take a photo of the calendar and keep it handy with you when you next do your grocery shopping.

The last session of food bank before Christmas will be on Saturday, Dec. 20, so we ask that you return your donation to the food bank by then. Please bring your donation to the church hall at 11am that day rather than clogging up the church porch.

Finally, please keep an eye out for needs around you and [just contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/). We'll also do our part in offering Hope.

God Bless.
