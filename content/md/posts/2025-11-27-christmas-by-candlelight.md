The Parish and the SVP are delighted to announce that we will be
jointly hosting a “Christmas by Candlelight” concert on Sunday
evening, Dec. 21, at 7.30pm in the church. We are thrilled to welcome
Trio Carina, a music trio, who will perform a programme of seasonal
music. During the interval, mulled wine and mince pies will be
available for all to enjoy.

All proceeds from the evening will be shared equally between parish
funds and the charitable works of the SVP. Tickets are £10 each and
can be purchased at the back of the church after all masses this
weekend. Children under 11 years old are free. We warmly invite you,
your family and friends to join us for what promises to be a joyful
and festive evening.

Finally, please keep an eye out for needs around you and just [contact
the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think that we can be of
help. We'll also do our best.

God Bless.
