The support of the parish underpins the SVP's activities. This weekend our team running our shop, Gifted,
would like to say a sincere 'Thank You' for all your custom during 2025. This is the final Gifted of the year, so make
the most of it! As ever, if there is something in particular that you would like, and you cannot see it displayed, then
just mention it to us and we'll try and source it for you.

Also, don't forget your tickets for 'Christmas by Candlelight' on Sunday, Dec. 21.

Finally, please keep an eye out for needs around you and just [contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you
think that we can be of help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
