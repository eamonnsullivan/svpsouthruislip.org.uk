Visiting the lonely is one of the cornerstones of the SVP mission. Be
it a lonely person at home, in a care home, in a hospital or in a
prison, the tradition of a regular face-to-face visit is one that is
ingrained in the SVP across the globe.

As we now approach the shortest day of the year please keep an eye on
your vulnerable neighbours and please let us know if there is anyone
who needs some company. And remember, also, that a significant
proportion of the UK's young people suffer from loneliness so please
keep an eye on these neighbours too.

With a larger team, we can address more of these issues. If you're
planning your 2026 resolutions, then do not forget to consider joining
the SVP. You won't regret it!!

Finally, please remain aware of need around you and just [contact the
SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think that we can be of help.
We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
