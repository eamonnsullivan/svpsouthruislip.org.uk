It might surprise you, but the day has already lengthened by 36
minutes since the shortest day! If this little piece of joyful news
sparks your spirit into action then why not consider harnessing that
energy?

Four young people did exactly that last weekend when they volunteered
to help at the food bank each Saturday as part of their Duke of
Edinburgh (DoE) commitments at school. They will gain some real
character-forming experience with us and we certainly hope they'll
stay volunteering at the food bank long after they have fulfilled
their formal DoE obligations.

If these young people inspire you, and if you also wish to volunteer,
then just [reach out](../../pages-output/contact/) to any member of
the SVP Team. It could be the New Year change you are looking for!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around you and just
contact the SVP if you think that we can be of help. We'll always do
our best.

God Bless.
