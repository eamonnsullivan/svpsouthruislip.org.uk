Our SVP fund raising shop, known as 'Gifted', will make its first appearance of 2026 next weekend in the church porch. We have procured some lovely new items and these include St Patrick's Day cards and gifts. If you like to get things done early, why not pop along and see what we have on offer? Please note that WE CAN ONLY ACCEPT CASH AT PRESENT as we get our electronic payment machine reconfigured.

Following on from last week's SVP News item, another two brilliant Duke of Edinburgh (DoE) volunteers joined us at the food bank on Saturday, bringing the total to six new young DoE volunteers since the start of January. It is clear that the Holy Spirit continues to work incredibly hard in our parish. What a blessing that is!

Finally, as always, please remain aware of need around you and [just contact the SVP](../../pages-output/contact/) if you think that we can be of help. We'll always do our best.

God Bless.
