The members of our Young Persons SVP group had a bake sale today after mass, raising funds to buy Christmas gifts for the residents of the Brackenbridge care home. The sale was a great success, with Â£500 collected. Thanks to all who baked and those who helped outside the church today.

A great day and a job well done!
