The path to God's house can be both a physical, as well as a spiritual, challenge. Recently, the SVP team, in combination with the Young Persons SVP and some neighbours, made an attempt at easing the physical journey of our parishioners.

On a humid, but dry, Sunday afternoon a team of 12 volunteers met to clear up the public footpath that leads down the side of the church grounds, from The Croft to Victoria Road. The footpath can be an eyesore at times and can make some parishioners feel vulnerable. A clean-up was proposed by the Young Persons SVP and a wonderful turnout was had!

At the end of three hours, we had cleared the path, making it look and feel much safer. Passing residents paid us unsolicited compliments and so we are sure our efforts were not wasted! We filled at least 10 black refuse bags and 7 large garden canvas bags - and this helped make it feel a very fulfilling experience.

More visits will be arranged before the winter arrives and then maybe the team will focus on some ideas for aiding the spiritual path to our Father in heaven.

God Bless, and Thank You to all who helped, in person and in spirit.
