The response of the parish to the recent Foodbank appeal has just been amazing, and a simple 'Thank You' just does not seem enough!

It just goes to prove that even the cloud of a pandemic can have a 'Wonder'-ful and 'Awe'-some silver lining. [The Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit](https://www.loyolapress.com/catholic-resources/scripture-and-tradition/catholic-basics/catholic-beliefs-and-practices/gifts-of-the-holy-spirit/) have been exhibited so strongly by the parish, and at such an appropriate time of the year too! Your 'Kindness', 'Generosity' and 'Love' means that our less fortunate sisters and brothers now have 'Knowledge', 'Understanding' and 'Hope' that they are not forgotten and that they are loved.

Can you just imagine what that must mean to someone who feels cut off from society -- to feel loved again? Your response has been such that we may now, even, be able to help other aspects of the Foodbank family through the [Hillingdon Foodbank](https://hillingdon.foodbank.org.uk/) headquarters in Uxbridge. We have always been a receiver from the HQ -- maybe now we'll be able to give back too! None of this would be possible without your response so, really, a huge 'Thank You' from all the team.

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of need in the community and, if help is needed, please [let us know](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
