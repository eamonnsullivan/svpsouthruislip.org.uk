This week we, the B-Attitudes, supported by volunteers from HSBC, did some gardening around the statue of Our Lady in the front garden of the church. All the weeds around it have been removed and replaced with beautiful white flowers and an arch will eventually cover the top of the statue to reduce damage from the rain.

As you can see from the photos, we worked really hard in the scorching sun. Thank you to everyone who supported us.
