As we come to the close of World Homeless Week, we would like to say a huge 'Thank You', on behalf of the B-Attitudes! Last Saturday evening, a group of seven hardy B-Attitudes, safeguarded by three SVP adult members, slept under the stars in support of our sisters and brothers who have to face this situation on a nightly basis. Our parishioners, and people even beyond our parish, donated to this cause to the amazing sum of Â£1,839.00. Please accept our sincerest thank you for this continual support and please pray for all those who remain homeless, be it World Homeless Week or be it not. The B-Attitudes will now be focusing on turning these funds into real action and we will keep you posted on progress.

Finally, as ever, please remain aware of the need around us and do not hesitate to [contact your SVP Team](../../pages-output/contact/) if our help is needed.

God Bless.
