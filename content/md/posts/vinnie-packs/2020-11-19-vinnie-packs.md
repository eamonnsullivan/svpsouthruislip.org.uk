The Young Persons SVP Team have been busy again! Last Sunday, a number of them, accompanied by some adult SVP members, helped prepare and pack 'Vinnie-Packs' for the homeless in the UK.

Each winter, for the last 10 years, a small team of SVP members in the Westminster Diocese procure, pack and distribute 11,500 Vinnie-Packs throughout the UK. Each pack contains a woolie hat, a pair of woolen gloves, 2 pairs of socks, toothbrush, toothpaste and wet wipes and a pen and paper with some useful Helpline numbers. Our volunteers made up approx 500 packs on Sunday and these were then distributed, as part of a bigger load, by SVP volunteer drivers on Monday and Tuesday!

The Vinnie-Packs operation is a real example of the gifts of the Holy Spirit being used by some really good people for the benefit of our sisters and brothers who have fallen on hard times. Please pray for them all and, as ever, if the help of your SVP Team is needed then we please [contact us](../../pages-output/contact/).

God Bless!
